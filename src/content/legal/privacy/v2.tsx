                  Tasks, comments, and file attachments you create or are added

                  A log of emails we have sent you (subject, recipient, status)
                  and a suppression list of addresses that have hard-bounced or
                  marked our mail as spam, so we can stop sending to them.
                </li>

                  Standard request logs generated by our hosting provider
                  (Google Cloud), such as IP address, user-agent, and request

                We hold your account data while your account is active and for
                a reasonable period after it becomes inactive, so we can
                restore it if you come back and so we can answer any questions

                account, we will do so without undue delay, subject to records
                we are required to keep (for example, suppression entries for
                addresses that have asked not to be contacted, kept so we do
                not re-contact them by mistake).

                <strong>For up to 30 days after deletion.</strong> When your
                account is deleted, whether by you or by us, we may keep your
                account data, the content you contributed, and our logs for up
                to 30 days afterwards. We do this so we can meet our legal
                obligations and, where it is necessary, investigate abuse or
                misuse of the site, including activity that may break the law.
                Once that period has passed we permanently delete or anonymise
                this information, except for the limited records described in
                this section that we are required or permitted to keep for
                longer.

                created while using the site is not always removed at the moment
                your account is deleted. In particular, tasks, comments, and
                file attachments you created or were added to in the committee
                tooling, and event RSVPs and the answers you gave, may be
                retained for a limited period so that ongoing committee work and
                event records are not disrupted. We then delete this content, or
                detach it from your identity, in line with the retention periods
                described here. If you need specific content removed sooner,
                email us and we will deal with it.

              <p>
                We rely on Google&apos;s infrastructure for at-rest and
                in-transit encryption, and on Firestore&apos;s rule engine to
                enforce access. Member personal data is readable only by
                committee members the Students&apos; Union has formally
                recognised, and by admins; ordinary members can only see their
                own record and the tasks they have been added to. Email is
                signed with DKIM and aligned with DMARC on the{" "}
                <code>naisi.uk</code> domain.
