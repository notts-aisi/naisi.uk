/**
 * ============================ OWNER TO CONFIRM ============================
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE MERGING. The wording of a privacy policy is the owner's,
 * not an agent's, and publishing it moves CURRENT_POLICY_VERSION, which asks
 * every member on the site to re-accept. Most of the new "Courses and
 * programmes" section is a description of what the code does and can be
 * checked against it. The sentences below are DIFFERENT: they state POLICY,
 * meaning they are promises about how NAISI will behave, and nothing in the
 * codebase can make them true or false. Each one has to be true of how the
 * committee actually runs the programme, or it has to be cut.
 *
 *  1. "Where an access-requirements answer includes health or disability
 *     information, we treat it as special category data and rely on your
 *     explicit consent." (Legal bases.) This is the lawful-basis claim for
 *     the most sensitive field the platform holds. If the committee would
 *     rather rely on a different condition, this sentence changes.
 *  2. "Your access requirements are never scored and never shown to
 *     reviewers." (Courses.) True of the code today, and a promise about
 *     every future route.
 *  3. "If you ask us what a reviewer wrote about your application, we will
 *     tell you." (Courses, and Your rights.) A commitment to answer subject
 *     access requests for reviewer notes rather than argue exemptions.
 *  4. "We will not use anything you write in a course to make decisions about
 *     you outside the programme." (Courses.)
 *  5. "Applications are kept against your account for as long as it exists,
 *     so you can see what you sent us." (Retention.) The owner decision was
 *     to keep applications rather than strip them after a fixed period; this
 *     sentence is that decision written down.
 *  6. "A certificate page stays online unless you ask us to withdraw it."
 *     (Courses.) States what happens to a published verification page, which
 *     names the recipient.
 *  7. "Deleting your account does not take a certificate down." (Retention,
 *     and Courses.) This is a CHOICE, and the opposite choice is just as
 *     defensible, so it is the one item here most worth a second look. The
 *     case for it: the verification page exists so somebody the holder sent
 *     the link to can check the certificate is real, and that is precisely
 *     the moment they are least likely to still have an account. The case
 *     against: a page naming a person outlives the account they closed.
 *     Whichever way this goes, the page and the code must agree.
 *     `accountDeletion.ts` has no certificate sweep today, so the wording
 *     below matches the build; reversing the decision means writing that
 *     sweep in the same change as the sentence, not after it.
 *  8. "Facilitators are students. They can see your attendance, your written
 *     work and the notes their colleagues wrote about you in their group."
 *     (Courses.) Deliberately blunt, because it is the fact a participant is
 *     least likely to guess. Confirm it is the level of frankness wanted.
 *  9. "We do not publish anything you write to the rest of your group unless
 *     you choose to share it." (Courses.)
 * 10. The date on this version (see POLICIES in src/lib/legal/policies.ts) is
 *     the planned live date, 16 September 2026. If the merge slips, move it.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * Version 3 of the Privacy Policy. v1 and v2 are FROZEN: they still render
 * unchanged at their archive URLs (/privacy/v/1 and /privacy/v/2), so this
 * file is a copy-and-edit of v2 rather than a refactor of it. Never reach
 * into an older version to share markup with this one.
 *
 * What changed from v2: a new "Courses and programmes" section covering the
 * admissions and learning platform, plus the courses-shaped additions to How
 * we use it, Legal bases, Retention and Your rights.

                  PhD, staff), subject or area of work, expected graduation
                  month if relevant, why you want to join, and a free-text

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your name and email address, along with the answers you give

                  The status of your RSVP (pending, confirmed, waitlisted,

              <h3>When you subscribe to our newsletter</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your email address, optional name, and a per-channel record
                  of whether you are currently subscribed, plus an audit trail
                  of subscribe and unsubscribe events.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you turn on push notifications, a push subscription from

                  and two keys that let us encrypt a message to that device.
                  It is tied to one browser on one device, not to you, and we
                  hold one record per device you enable. Turning notifications
                  off in the site or in your browser deletes it.

              </ul>

              <h3>Operational logs</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A log of emails we have sent you (subject, recipient, status)
                  and a suppression list of addresses that have hard-bounced or
                  marked our mail as spam, so we can stop sending to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A record of the spreadsheet downloads the site generates
                  (registers, rosters, application tables, membership lists):
                  who asked for it, what it covered, how many people were in

                We run application-based programmes (the research incubator and
                the fellowships) and open-entry ones (the pre-course). Applying
                and taking part both create records about you, and some of them
                are written by other students. This section lists all of them,
                who can see each one, and how long we keep it.
              </p>

              <h3>When you apply</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Your answers.</strong> Everything you type into the
                  application form, including drafts. Drafts are saved on our
                  servers, not just in your browser, so that you can come back
                  to a part-written application on another device. A draft you
                  never submit is still an application record until you delete
                  it or your account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Your availability.</strong> The grid where you mark
                  which times you could attend in person. We use it to build
                  groups and nothing else.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Your programme preferences.</strong> Which programme
                  and stream you applied for, and how you ranked your choices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Access requirements.</strong> The optional box asking
                  whether there is anything we should know to make the
                  programme work for you. In practice people use it to tell us
                  about disability, health, caring responsibilities or similar,
                  so we treat whatever you write there as sensitive. It is
                  stored separately from the rest of your application, in a
                  different place in our database, so that it cannot be swept
                  into a scoring screen or a spreadsheet by accident. Your
                  access requirements are never scored and never shown to
                  reviewers. Only the person making the final decision and site
                  admins can open it, they have to open it deliberately, and
                  every time one of them does we record who read it and when.
                  Leaving it blank does not count against you. We do not ask
                  for your date of birth anywhere.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Whether you are a paid member,</strong> and where
                  that came from (see membership below). This is shown to the
                  person making the final decision and to admins. It is hidden
                  from reviewers and it does not affect whether you are
                  offered a place.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When we review your application</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reviewer scores and notes.</strong> Each reviewer
                  scores your application against the round&apos;s criteria and
                  can write free-text notes about it. Reviewers are other
                  students: SU-recognised committee members and admins. They
                  review name-blind, meaning your name is hidden from them,
                  though a piece of writing can of course identify its author.
                  Scores and notes are personal data about you. If you ask us
                  what a reviewer wrote about your application, we will tell
                  you, and reviewers are told that before they write anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The decision,</strong> its date, who made it, and the
                  reason. Where we share a reason with you we send it by email;
                  an internal reason that we have not shared is still yours to
                  ask for.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>While you are on a programme</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Attendance registers.</strong> Your facilitator marks
                  each session: present, arrived late, left early, absent, or
                  excused. You can see your own attendance once a session has
                  been submitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Participant notes.</strong> After a session your
                  facilitator can write a private note about a named
                  participant, for example about how someone is finding the
                  material or that they mentioned they would miss next week.
                  Facilitators are students. These notes are personal data
                  about you, and if you ask to see the notes written about you,
                  we will show you them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Your written work.</strong> Answers to exercises,
                  your progress through each week&apos;s materials, and any
                  feedback a facilitator writes on your work. We do not publish
                  anything you write to the rest of your group unless you
                  choose to share it, and we will not use anything you write in
                  a course to make decisions about you outside the programme.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Feedback and surveys.</strong> Weekly feedback forms
                  and any before-and-after surveys we run. Where a form says it
                  is anonymous, we store the answers with no link to you: your
                  identity is not recorded on the response at all, and we keep
                  a separate note that you responded so we stop reminding you.
                  Where a form is not anonymous it says so, and the answers are
                  stored against your account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dropping out.</strong> If you leave a programme we
                  record that you left and, if you tell us, why.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Membership</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your membership tier (paid, comped, alumni, staff) for a
                  given year, and where we learned it: a list the
                  Students&apos; Union gives us, or an admin adding you by
                  hand. You can see your own tier on your profile.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Conduct</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If there has been a conduct concern, an admin can flag an
                  account and must record a reason. Reviewers see only that a
                  flag exists, never the reason. The reason is visible to
                  admins alone. It is personal data about you and you can ask
                  us for it.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Certificates</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When you complete a programme we can issue a certificate with
                  a verification page anyone holding the link can open. That
                  page names you, the programme and the date, so that an
                  employer can check the certificate is real. The link is not
                  guessable and the page is not listed anywhere. A certificate
                  page stays online unless you ask us to withdraw it, which you
                  can do at any time by emailing us. That includes after you
                  delete your account: deleting the account does not take the
                  page down, because the page is there for the people you sent
                  the link to. Ask us and we will withdraw it, account or no
                  account.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Downloads</h3>
              <p>
                Staff sometimes need a spreadsheet: a register to take to a
                session, a roster, the applications for a round, a membership
                list. Downloads generated by the site are recorded, with who
                asked for it, what it covered, how many people were in it and
                when. We are being careful with that sentence: it means we log
                the files the site produces. It does not mean we can track a
                file once it has been downloaded, and it does not cover
                somebody copying what is on their screen.
              </p>

              <h3>Who can see what</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reviewers</strong> (SU-recognised committee members
                  and admins, all of them students) see applications without
                  names, their own and other reviewers&apos; scores and notes,
                  and a conduct flag if there is one. They do not see access
                  requirements, membership tier, or the reason behind a conduct
                  flag.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The person making the final decision</strong> sees
                  everything a reviewer sees, with names, plus membership tier,
                  plus access requirements when they open them, which is
                  recorded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Facilitators</strong> (students, in most cases only a
                  year or two ahead of you) see their own groups: who is in
                  them, contact details, attendance, written work, and the
                  participant notes their colleagues wrote about people in that
                  group. They do not see applications or review scores.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Other participants</strong> see the names of the
                  people in their group, and nothing else about them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Admins</strong> can see all of the above. Admin
                  actions on this material are logged.

                <strong>Course applications and course records.</strong>{" "}
                Applications are kept against your account for as long as it
                exists, so you can see what you sent us and so we can make
                sense of a later application from the same person. We do not
                strip them after a fixed period. The same goes for the rest of
                your course record: attendance, written work, feedback you gave
                us, and notes written about you. If you want any of it removed
                sooner, email us. Deleting your account deletes all of that,
                including your access-requirements answer, your applications
                and drafts, the review scores and notes written about you, your
                marks on registers and the notes about you on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Certificates are the exception.</strong> A certificate
                and its verification page are not removed when your account is
                deleted. The page exists so that somebody you sent the link to
                can check the certificate is real, and that is the moment you
                are least likely to still have an account with us. It stays
                online until you ask us to withdraw it, which you can do at any
                time by emailing us, whether or not you still have an account.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>For up to 30 days after deletion.</strong> When your
                account is deleted, whether by you or by us, we may keep your
                account data, the content you contributed, and our logs for up
                to 30 days afterwards. We do this so we can meet our legal
                obligations and, where it is necessary, investigate abuse or
                misuse of the site, including activity that may break the law.
                Once that period has passed we permanently delete or anonymise
                this information, except for the limited records described in
                this section that we are required or permitted to keep for
                longer.

                <strong>Content you contributed.</strong> Some content you
                created while using the site is not always removed at the moment
                your account is deleted. In particular, tasks, comments, and
                file attachments you created or were added to in the committee
                tooling, and event RSVPs and the answers you gave, may be
                retained for a limited period so that ongoing committee work and
                event records are not disrupted. We then delete this content, or
                detach it from your identity, in line with the retention periods
                described here. If you need specific content removed sooner,
                email us and we will deal with it.

                Audit-style records are kept for as long as needed to
                investigate issues and meet our accountability obligations, and
                are not removed when an account is deleted. These are records
                of what staff did rather than of what you wrote: the email send
                log, the subscription event log, the impersonation log used for
                committee oversight, the log of course actions including who
                read an access-requirements answer, and the record of downloads
                the site generated. They name the person who took the action
                and what it concerned, and hold no course answers, marks or
                notes.

                A request for a copy of your data covers what other people have
                written about you as well as what you wrote yourself. For
                courses that means the scores and notes a reviewer recorded on
                your application, the notes a facilitator wrote about you, and
                the reason behind a conduct flag. Ask us and we will tell you.
                Where a record names somebody else as well as you we may need
                to redact their part of it.

                We rely on Google&apos;s infrastructure for at-rest and
                in-transit encryption, and on Firestore&apos;s rule engine to
                enforce access. Member personal data is readable only by
                committee members the Students&apos; Union has formally
                recognised, and by admins; ordinary members can only see their
                own record and the tasks they have been added to. Course
                material about a named person (applications, access
                requirements, registers, participant notes) is served only
                through checks on our servers, never handed to a browser that
                has no reason for it. Email is signed with DKIM and aligned
                with DMARC on the <code>naisi.uk</code> domain.
