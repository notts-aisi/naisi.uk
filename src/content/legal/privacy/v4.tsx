/**
 * Version 4 of the Privacy Policy, checked sentence by sentence against the
 * code on 6 September 2026.
 *
 * What changed from v3: the worksheet activity sentence, and the corrections
 * that check turned up (deletion by email rather than a button, what a
 * deletion removes and what it keeps, no 30-day purge, only the two exports
 * that are logged, collaborator applications, email-and-password signups, the
 * SU membership file, reCAPTCHA, the full cookie and local storage list,
 * per-round blind settings, the star rating in place of anonymous surveys,
 * what other participants see, the push record, view-as, and the worksheet
 * recipient picker).
 *
 * Second pass, on the owner's decisions: certificates described as the
 * participant minting their own, opt-in, with the retention carve-out that
 * follows; who is name-blind and who is deliberately not; anonymous feedback
 * as a thing we would announce before building; the push record going with
 * the account; re-consent replacing the promise of an email; a 30-day
 * response time; and the standard lines this policy had never carried, on
 * automated decisions, children, event dietary answers, the Google avatar,
 * video thumbnails in email, the export kinds, and Google's sign-in script.
 *
 * v1, v2 and v3 are FROZEN: they still render unchanged at their archive URLs
 * (/privacy/v/1, /privacy/v/2 and /privacy/v/3), so this file is a
 * copy-and-edit of v3 rather than a refactor of it. Never reach into an older
 * version to share markup with this one. The date on this version (see
 * POLICIES in src/lib/legal/policies.ts) is the owner's to set.

              <p>
                We only collect what we need to run the society and the site.
                The categories below cover everything we hold. Course
                applications and course participation add several more, and
                they have <a href="#courses">a section of their own</a>.
              </p>

              <h3>When you sign in with Google</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your Google account profile, namely your display name, email
                  address, and profile photo URL.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A Firebase Auth session record so we can keep you signed in
                  across visits.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your Google profile photo is shown wherever your avatar
                  appears, and that includes public pages if you opt into the
                  members directory. The image itself stays with Google: a
                  visitor&apos;s browser fetches it from Google&apos;s servers,
                  which tells Google that somebody loaded the page it is on.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When you create an account with an email address</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you create an account with an email address rather than
                  through Google, we hold that address, a password you set
                  yourself (stored by Firebase Auth, never by us in readable
                  form), and a record of the signup itself: when you started
                  it, whether you confirmed your address, whether you finished,
                  and how many verification emails we sent. That record stays
                  even if you never finish signing up, until you ask us to
                  remove it.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When you register as a member</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A University of Nottingham email address that you verify
                  through a one-time magic-link sent to that address.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Profile fields you fill in, including preferred name,
                  affiliation status (for example undergraduate, master&apos;s,
                  PhD, staff), subject or area of work, expected graduation
                  month if relevant, why you want to join, and a free-text
                  interests field.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your notification preferences, broken down by channel (Google
                  inbox, university inbox) and category (newsletter, events).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When you apply as an external collaborator</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your name and email address, the institution or company you
                  are at and your role there, the project you are proposing and
                  your background, any LinkedIn or portfolio link you give us,
                  the areas you are interested in, how you heard about us, and
                  whether you already know somebody on the committee (and who,
                  if you tell us).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The decision on your application and, where it is turned
                  down, the reason we recorded.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When you RSVP to an event</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your name and email address, along with the answers you give
                  to that event&apos;s signup questions (for example dietary
                  notes, accessibility needs, or any custom fields the
                  organiser added).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The status of your RSVP (pending, confirmed, waitlisted,
                  cancelled), and any later change requests you submit.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When you subscribe to our newsletter</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your email address, optional name, and a per-channel record
                  of whether you are currently subscribed, plus an audit trail
                  of subscribe and unsubscribe events.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When you install the site as an app</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you turn on push notifications, a push subscription from
                  your browser: an endpoint URL issued by your browser vendor
                  and two keys that let us encrypt a message to that device.
                  The record is tied to one browser on one device and carries
                  your account so we know where to send, together with your
                  browser&apos;s user-agent string and the last time that
                  device checked in. We hold one record per device you enable.
                  Turning notifications off deletes it, and so does deleting
                  your account.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When you join the committee</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Optional public-profile fields such as a title and short bio,
                  if you choose to appear on the Members page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tasks, comments, and file attachments you create or are added
                  to inside the committee tooling area of the site. These are
                  visible to other committee members under the access rules
                  described in our role model.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When a worksheet is sent to you, we record when you first
                  opened it, how many times you moved between its pages, when
                  you were last active on it, and roughly how long you spent on
                  it, sampled in half-minute steps while the page is in front
                  of you. The person who sent it, the worksheet&apos;s author,
                  your reviewers and site admins can see those figures. We do
                  not record which page you were on, what you typed, or when
                  you pasted.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Operational logs</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A log of emails we have sent you (subject, recipient, status)
                  and a suppression list of addresses that have hard-bounced or
                  marked our mail as spam, so we can stop sending to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A record of the spreadsheet downloads the site generates. Two
                  kinds are logged today, a membership list and the responses
                  to a circulated worksheet, and each row holds who asked for
                  it, what it covered, how many people were in it, and when.
                  See{" "}
                  <a href="#courses">Courses and programmes</a> for what that
                  does and does not cover.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Standard request logs generated by our hosting provider
                  (Google Cloud), such as IP address, user-agent, and request
                  timestamps. We do not use these for analytics; they exist to
                  help debug errors and protect the service from abuse.

              <h2>Courses and programmes</h2>
              <p>
                We run application-based programmes (the research incubator and
                the fellowships) and open-entry ones (the pre-course). Applying
                and taking part both create records about you, and some of them
                are written by other students. This section lists all of them,
                who can see each one, and how long we keep it.
              </p>

              <h3>When you apply</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Your answers.</strong> Everything you type into the
                  application form, including drafts. Drafts are saved on our
                  servers, not just in your browser, so that you can come back
                  to a part-written application on another device. A draft you
                  never submit is still an application record until you delete
                  it or your account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Your availability.</strong> The grid where you mark
                  which times you could attend in person. We use it to build
                  groups and nothing else.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Your programme preferences.</strong> Which programme
                  and stream you applied for, and how you ranked your choices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Access requirements.</strong> The optional box asking
                  whether there is anything we should know to make the
                  programme work for you. In practice people use it to tell us
                  about disability, health, caring responsibilities or similar,
                  so we treat whatever you write there as sensitive. It is
                  stored separately from the rest of your application, in a
                  different place in our database, so that it cannot be swept
                  into a scoring screen or a spreadsheet by accident. Your
                  access requirements are never scored and never shown to
                  reviewers. Only the person making the final decision and site
                  admins can open it, they have to open it deliberately, and
                  every time one of them does we record who read it and when.
                  Leaving it blank does not count against you. We do not ask
                  for your date of birth anywhere.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Whether you are a paid member,</strong> and where
                  that came from (see membership below). This is shown to the
                  person making the final decision and to admins. It is hidden
                  from reviewers by default and it does not affect whether you
                  are offered a place.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When we review your application</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reviewer scores and notes.</strong> Each reviewer
                  scores your application against the round&apos;s criteria and
                  can write free-text notes about it. Reviewers are other
                  students: SU-recognised committee members and admins.
                  Reviewers score name-blind by default: a round&apos;s author
                  can switch that off, and the application form will say so
                  when they have. Your membership tier is hidden from reviewers
                  by default in the same way. The final decider and the admins
                  who make the decision and place you in a group are never
                  blind. They see your name and your whole application, because
                  deciding where you will do best is a judgement about you. A
                  piece of writing can of course identify its author.
                  Scores and notes are personal data about you. If you ask us
                  what a reviewer wrote about your application, we will tell
                  you, and reviewers are told that before they write anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The decision,</strong> its date, who made it, and the
                  reason. Where we share a reason with you we send it by email;
                  an internal reason that we have not shared is still yours to
                  ask for.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>While you are on a programme</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Attendance registers.</strong> Your facilitator marks
                  each session: present, arrived late, left early, absent, or
                  excused. You can see your own attendance once a session has
                  been submitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Participant notes.</strong> After a session your
                  facilitator can write a private note about a named
                  participant, for example about how someone is finding the
                  material or that they mentioned they would miss next week.
                  Facilitators are students. These notes are personal data
                  about you, and if you ask to see the notes written about you,
                  we will show you them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Your written work.</strong> Answers to exercises,
                  your progress through each week&apos;s materials, and any
                  feedback a facilitator writes on your work. You can also keep
                  a private note against a piece of material: it is not shown
                  to the rest of your run, but your facilitator and site admins
                  can read it. We do not publish
                  anything you write to the rest of your group unless you
                  choose to share it, and we will not use anything you write in
                  a course to make decisions about you outside the programme.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Feedback on the material.</strong> You can give a
                  piece of course material a star rating and leave a comment on
                  it. Both are stored against your account and your name, and
                  the comment is shown to the rest of your run. We do not
                  currently run anonymous surveys on this site. If we add one,
                  the form will say that it is anonymous and how that is done,
                  and we will update this policy first.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dropping out.</strong> If you leave a programme we
                  record that you left and, if you tell us, why.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Membership</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your membership tier (paid, comped, alumni, staff) for a
                  given year, and where we learned it: a list the
                  Students&apos; Union gives us, or an admin adding you by
                  hand. You can see your own tier on your profile.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the Students&apos; Union gives us a membership list, we
                  keep the file as we received it: for each person on it, their
                  name, the email addresses on the list, and their membership
                  tier, together with a note of which NAISI account, if any, we
                  matched them to. We keep it so a membership can be checked or
                  corrected later. If you are on that list and have no account
                  with us, you can ask us to remove your row.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Conduct</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If there has been a conduct concern, an admin can flag an
                  account and must record a reason. Reviewers see only that a
                  flag exists, never the reason. The reason is visible to
                  admins alone. It is personal data about you and you can ask
                  us for it.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Certificates</h3>
              <p>
                When you complete the fellowship or the incubator you will be
                able to mint a certificate for yourself. Nothing is issued
                unless you choose to: if you would rather no page on our site
                named you, simply never mint one. If you do mint one, it
                creates a page that names you, the programme and the date,
                which anyone holding the link can open. The link is not
                guessable and the page is not listed anywhere. It stays until
                you ask us to withdraw it, which you can do at any time by
                emailing us, including after your account is deleted, because
                the people you sent the link to still need it. By applying to a
                programme you agree that we may offer this.
              </p>

              <h3>Downloads</h3>
              <p>
                Staff sometimes need a spreadsheet: a register to take to a
                session, a roster, the applications for a round, a membership
                list. Two of those downloads are recorded, with who asked for
                it, what it covered, how many people were in it and when: the
                membership list, and the answers to a circulated worksheet.
                Both refuse to hand over the file if that record cannot be
                written. The event attendee list and the subscriber list are
                built in your browser and are not recorded. We are being
                careful with that sentence: it means we log two of the files
                the site produces. It does not mean we can track a file once it
                has been downloaded, and it does not cover somebody copying
                what is on their screen.
              </p>

              <h3>Who can see what</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reviewers</strong> (SU-recognised committee members
                  and admins, all of them students) score name-blind by
                  default, so they see your application without your name
                  unless the round&apos;s author turned that off. They also see
                  their own and other reviewers&apos; scores and notes, and a
                  conduct flag if there is one. They do not see access
                  requirements, the membership tier, or the reason behind a
                  conduct flag.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The person making the final decision,</strong> and
                  the admins who take that decision and place people into
                  groups, see everything a reviewer sees, with names, plus
                  membership tier, plus access requirements when they open
                  them, which is recorded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Facilitators</strong> (students, in most cases only a
                  year or two ahead of you) see their own groups: who is in
                  them, contact details, attendance, written work, and the
                  participant notes their colleagues wrote about people in that
                  group. They do not see applications or review scores.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Other participants</strong> on your run see your
                  name, and any comment or star rating you choose to leave on a
                  piece of course material. They see nothing else about you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Admins</strong> can see all of the above. Admin
                  actions on this material are logged.

                In your browser&apos;s own local storage the site keeps four

                collapsed the committee-area sidebar),{" "}
                <code>naisi.lastRoute</code> (the last page you had open, so
                the installed app can return you to it),{" "}
                <code>naisi.installCard.dismissed</code> (that you have
                dismissed the prompt to install the app), and{" "}
                <code>naisi.auth.loaderOpen</code> (whether the sign-in panel
                was open). Signing in also stores your session tokens in your
                browser&apos;s own storage, which Firebase Auth keeps in
                IndexedDB. You can clear all of it from your browser&apos;s

                We hold your account data while your account is active and for
                a reasonable period after it becomes inactive, so we can

                <strong>Course applications and course records.</strong>{" "}
                Applications are kept against your account for as long as it
                exists, so you can see what you sent us and so we can make
                sense of a later application from the same person. We do not
                strip them after a fixed period. The same goes for the rest of
                your course record: attendance, written work, feedback you gave
                us, and notes written about you. If you want any of it removed
                sooner, email us.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Asking us to delete your account.</strong> Email us and
                we will delete it, without undue delay. There is no
                self-service delete button once you are a member or an approved
                collaborator, because taking somebody&apos;s work out of the
                committee tooling is done by hand: an admin runs the deletion.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What a deletion removes.</strong> Your account record
                and profile, your newsletter subscriptions and their history,
                your collaborator application if you made one, any outstanding
                email-verification links, your course enrolments, applications
                and drafts, your progress and your answers to exercises, your
                admission applications together with the access-requirements
                answer stored separately beside them, the review scores and
                notes written about those applications and any you wrote about
                somebody else, a conduct flag if there is one, your membership
                records and the lines naming you on a Students&apos; Union
                membership file, and your sign-in record. Your marks and the
                notes about you are stripped out of attendance registers, which
                stay for the rest of the group.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What a deletion leaves behind.</strong> These are not
                removed:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  A short record of each application you made: what you applied
                  for, the decision, and the scores and notes the reviewers
                  wrote. We keep it deliberately, so that a later application
                  from the same person can be read in context. The reviewers&apos;
                  scores and notes about an application stay in that record
                  after the account is deleted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Worksheets that were sent to you: your answers, and the
                  reviews written on them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tasks you were on, with their comments, activity and

                </li>
                <li>
                  Event RSVPs, including the name, email address and any

                </li>
                <li>
                  Files you uploaded. Nothing in file storage is removed by an
                  account deletion.

                <li>
                  The log of emails we sent you, and a suppression entry if
                  your address ever bounced or reported us as spam, kept so we
                  do not write to it again by mistake.
                </li>
                <li>The audit-style records described below.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>A certificate you minted is a deliberate
                exception.</strong> If you chose to mint one, its page is not
                removed when your account is deleted, because it exists for the
                people you sent the link to and that is the moment you are
                least likely to still have an account with us. Email us and we
                will withdraw it, account or no account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of what you contributed stays after your account goes,
                because removing it would break work other people are still
                doing. We remove it when we clear it out by hand, and you can
                ask us to remove specific items sooner.
              </p>
              <p>
                Audit-style records are kept for as long as needed to
                investigate issues and meet our accountability obligations, and
                are not removed when an account is deleted. These are records
                of what staff did rather than of what you wrote: the email send
                log, the subscription event log, the impersonation log used for
                committee oversight, the log of course actions including who
                read an access-requirements answer, and the record of the two
                downloads the site logs. They name the person who took the
                action and what it concerned, and hold no course answers, marks
                or notes.

                enforce access. Member personal data is readable only by
                committee members the Students&apos; Union has formally
                recognised, and by admins, and by the small number of people we
                have given permission to circulate a worksheet, who can see
                members&apos; names and photos in order to choose recipients.
                Ordinary members can only see their own record and the tasks
                they have been added to. Course
                material about a named person (applications, access
