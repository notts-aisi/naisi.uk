/**
 * Stamp the signed-in user's `profile.uniEmailVerifiedAt` from the server-side
 * proof of verification (the `emailVerifications` record), if one exists.
 *
 * Called by `completeRegistration` right after the user doc is created: during
 * the verify-first register flow the user may have clicked their uni-email magic
 * link BEFORE the user doc existed, so `confirmUniEmailVerification` couldn't
 * stamp the doc then. This closes that gap SERVER-SIDE.
 *
 * Authenticated as the user themselves and only ever acts on the caller's own
 * uid; the stamp value comes from server-only data, so there's no oracle and
 * nothing the client can forge. Idempotent — safe to call repeatedly.
