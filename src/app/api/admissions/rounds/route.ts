/**
 * The rounds INDEX: list the rounds this caller may see, and create a new one.
 *
 * ## Why a route at all
 *
 * `admissionRounds` is `allow read, write: if false`, both halves. The write
 * half is the usual one (counters, role arrays). The read half is the sharper
 * one: the round document carries live `applicationCounts`, so a signed-in
 * read would let any fresher watch a competitive intake's submitted and
 * accepted counters move all through the week their own application is being
 * decided, and it carries `finalDeciderUid`, which names the person deciding
 * it. So there is no client read to fall back on and this list is the only way
 * a staff surface sees a round.
 *
 * ## Who sees what
 *
 * The GET answers for any signed-in caller and filters per round: authors
 * (admin or `approveCourse`) and `draftCourse` holders see every round;
 * everyone else sees only the rounds that name them as a reviewer or as the
 * final decider. A caller on no round gets an empty list rather than a 403,
 * because "there are rounds you cannot see" is itself information about a
 * competitive intake, and because the Admissions nav entry appearing for a
 * reviewer whose round has since ended should show them an empty page, not an
 * error.

 * Create a round. Admin or `approveCourse`.
 *
 * Everything except the label and the kind is a DEFAULT, and the defaults are
 * the shipped ones rather than empties: the reminder schedule, the score
 * scale, the availability grid and the blind settings all arrive already
 * sensible, so a round that opens without anybody touching those sections is
 * still a round that behaves the way the design says it does. The readiness
 * panel then names the handful of things that genuinely cannot be defaulted:
 * the dates, the questions, the people.
 *
 * A FIRST STAGE is created in the same batch. A round with no stages shows an
 * applicant an empty form, and "add a stage before you add a question" is a
 * step with no meaning to anybody: every round has at least one block of
 * questions, so the object starts with one.
