/**
 * Appoint this round's reviewers and its final decider.
 *
 * ## Admin only, and a tighter gate than the rest of the console
 *
 * Everything else on a round is authoring: dates, wording, criteria. This is
 * an ACCESS GRANT. Membership of `reviewerUids` IS the permission to read
 * applications, which are member PII plus free text about people's
 * circumstances, and `finalDeciderUid` is the person who can accept and reject.
 * A `approveCourse` holder may author the round they will run; they may not
 * decide who reads it.
 *
 * ## Eligibility is checked against the live user document
 *
 * A reviewer must be an admin or SU-recognised committee, which is the same
 * trust boundary that already gates the `users` collection and the committee
 * task board rather than a looser one invented here. That is checked by
 * reading each candidate's user document at request time, never from anything
 * the browser sent: a stale console (or a hand-made request) naming somebody
 * whose recognition was withdrawn last week is refused, and the refusal names
 * them rather than silently dropping them, because a reviewer who vanishes
 * from a saved list is a round that quietly ends up under-staffed.
 *
 * ## Why it also writes `users.admissionsReviewer`
 *
 * The Admissions entry in the sidebar is gated client-side from the `useAuth`
 * snapshot, which is a live listener on the caller's own user document.
 * There is no field behind "this uid appears in some round's reviewerUids", so
 * without a denormalisation the entry either costs an `admissionRounds` query
 * on every authed navigation for every user, or it never appears for exactly
 * the non-admin SU reviewers the reviewer surface exists to serve. So this
 * route stamps a server-owned boolean on everyone it adds, and CLEARS it on
 * everyone it removes who is not still named on another round.
 *
 * The flag is a nav hint and nothing else. Every admissions route re-checks
 * the round's own arrays, so a stale `true` grants nothing and a stale `false`
 * costs a link, not access.
