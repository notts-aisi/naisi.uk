/**
 * Decide one application on an APPOINTMENT round: appoint this person to
 * facilitate a run, or tell them we cannot this time.
 *
 * ## Why the appointment half exists on its own, before the enrolment half
 *
 * A facilitator round closes on 4 October and facilitator training starts on
 * the 5th. The enrolment decide path (scores, coverage, seat rows, fellowship
 * offers, reinstatement) is not needed until the 23rd, and every attempt to
 * build them together scheduled the appointment behind the scoring machinery,
 * which lands eleven days after the training it is supposed to invite people
 * to. So this route serves the appointment branch and answers 400 on an
 * enrolment round, in words that say when the other half arrives.
 *
 * ## What is refused before the transaction opens
 *
 * An enrolment round (400, because that half is not built), and a round that
 * is archived, still a draft or cancelled (409). The last three are the states
 * the stage-release route already refuses on, and they matter more here: a
 * decide on one of them writes a facilitator list, moves two counters and
 * mails somebody about a round that is not running.
 *
 * ## One transaction, and it holds everything that must be true at once
 *
 *  - the application is still `submitted` on THIS round and undecided;
 *  - the target run is one an appointment may still be made onto, and it has
 *    a start date, because the email names the first day;
 *  - the uid joins `courseRuns.runFacilitatorUids`;
 *  - the outcome and the terminal status land on the application;
 *  - the round's counters move `submitted` down one and the new status up one;
 *  - one `courseAudit` row is created for an appointment.
 *
 * The audit row is written INSIDE the transaction rather than before it. The
 * `enrol-mode` precedent writes first, because there a row for a write that
 * then failed is a harmless extra line; here the commonest failure is not a
 * crash but an idempotent no-op (see below), and a row for a decide that
 * changed nothing would put a second "appointed" line in the log for one
 * appointment. Created in the transaction, there is exactly one row per
 * appointment and none for anything else.
 *
 * ## Idempotency, because this button gets pressed twice
 *
 * The queue is worked through in one sitting on a deadline evening, often on a
 * phone, often by two people at once. So:
 *
 *  - the SAME decision on an already-decided row answers 200
 *    `{ alreadyDecided: true }`, moves no counter and sends no email;
 *  - a DIFFERENT decision on an already-decided row is refused with 409,
 *    because the email for the first one has already gone out and silently
 *    overwriting it is not something a queue may do on its own.
 *
 * `appointmentDecideDisposition` is that logic, pure and executed by a test.
 *
 * ## The email is sent AFTER the commit and cannot fail the decision
 *
 * `sendAdmissionEmail` swallows everything (a suppressed address, an SMTP
 * outage, a missing template), so the worst case is a courtesy outstanding
 * rather than a committed appointment answered with a 500 that reads as "it
 * did not save". Nothing below the transaction writes a document.
 *
 * The same is true of the decision push that goes with it: it is mirrored to
 * whatever devices the applicant has enabled, respects their
 * `notifications.push.courses` switch, sends nothing where the
 * environment has no VAPID configuration, and cannot fail the decision.
