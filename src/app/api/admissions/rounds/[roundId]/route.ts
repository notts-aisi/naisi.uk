/**
 * One round: read it, and edit everything about it EXCEPT the three things
 * that belong to their own routes.
 *
 * ## What this route deliberately cannot write
 *
 *  - `status`, which is a machine with a transition table
 *    (`POST .../status`). A PATCH that could set it would be that table's
 *    second, unenforced door.
 *  - `reviewerUids` and `finalDeciderUid` (`PUT .../roles`). Appointing a
 *    reviewer also writes the server-owned `users.admissionsReviewer` flag on
 *    the people involved, so it is admin-only and transactional; folding it
 *    into the general editor PATCH would put a user-document write behind
 *    every save of a blurb.
 *  - `stageIds` and everything under `stages` (`PUT .../stages/[stageId]`).
 *  - `applicationCounts`, which only the apply and decide routes move.
 *
 * A body naming any of them is refused rather than ignored, because a console
 * that thinks it saved a reviewer list and a server that quietly dropped it is
 * the failure that surfaces on decision day.
 *
 * ## The submitted-applications freeze
 *
 * Once anyone has SUBMITTED, `criteria` and `programmePreference` are frozen
 * behind an explicit `force`. Both are retrospective: criteria are what every
 * existing review was scored against, so renaming one silently relabels
 * decisions already made, and dropping one orphans the scores stored under its
 * id. Programme preference is worse, because an applicant answered it: pulling
 * a fellowship option out from under a submitted ranking leaves a stored
 * preference for something the round no longer offers.
 *
 * Neither is forbidden outright, because a typo in a criterion label two hours
 * into a window is a real thing that happens. It is forced, with a typed
 * confirmation on the client, so it is a decision somebody made rather than a
 * side effect of pressing save.
 *
 * ## What an appointment round cannot have
 *
 * The facilitator intake is a round of kind `appointment`: it appoints people
 * to run a group rather than placing them on one. Two sections of the document
 * therefore have nothing legitimate to hold on it, and both are REFUSED with a
 * sentence rather than normalised away:
 *
 *  - `outcomeRunIds`, because the decide route has no seat to mint and would be
 *    reading a target nobody meant.
 *  - `programmePreference`, because the apply flow renders no programme section
 *    for this kind, so anything stored here is an answer to a question no
 *    applicant was ever shown.
 *
 * Refusing is what makes the apply flow's kind check and this route agree. A
 * quiet normalise would leave the console showing a section it had apparently
 * saved, which is the same class of failure as the dropped reviewer list.
 */

const L = ADMISSION_ROUND_FIELD_LIMITS;

/**
 * Fields fixed when the round is created.
 *
 * `kind` decides which half of this route's own validation a body is held to,
 * which sections the console draws and which form an applicant is shown, and
 * an appointment round that had already collected facilitator applications
 * would answer none of those questions the same way after a flip. There is no
 * migration behind such a change and no honest one to write, so the kind is
 * chosen once, on the create form, and refused here rather than ignored: a
 * console that believed it changed the kind and a server that dropped the key
 * is the failure nobody notices until an applicant is looking at the wrong
 * form.
