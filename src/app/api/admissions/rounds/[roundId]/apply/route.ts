 * The applicant's own row on an admission round: read it, start it, save it,

 *   GET    - the caller's own application, projected for its owner
 *   POST   - start a draft, or re-open a withdrawn one while the window is open
 *   PATCH  - the explicit Save and the form's two-minute autosave
 *   DELETE - withdraw
 *
 * Submitting is deliberately somewhere else (`POST .../apply/submit`), because
 * it is a different act with a different validation contract: a save accepts a
 * half-written form, a submit does not.
 *
 * ## Everything server-side, and the draft is a real row
 *
 * `admissionApplications` is `allow read, write: if false`. The row carries a
 * server-sourced email, a paid-membership snapshot, reviewer-only evidence and
 * a decision, and the round's counters have to move in the same transaction as
 * the status. So there is no client-direct write anywhere in this feature, and
 * the draft an applicant is halfway through IS the document, which is what
 * makes it survive a refresh, a backgrounded phone and a flat battery.
 *
 * ## Withdrawal is not terminal
 *
 * While the window is open, withdrawing and applying again reuses the SAME
 * row: status goes back to `draft`, `reapplyCount` goes up by one, and the
 * answers already written are still there. A second row was never an option
 * (the doc id is `${roundId}__${uid}`, which is the one-per-person invariant),
 * and deleting the first would throw away answers somebody may have spent an
 * evening on because they pressed a button meaning "not right now".
 *
 * Once the window closes, a withdrawal is final: re-opening it would let
 * somebody re-enter a queue after the deadline everyone else met.

 * their own words, which is only true while the session really is theirs.

/**
 * Save a draft.
 *
 * ## What "released only" means here
 *
 * Answers are validated against the RELEASED stages, with
 * `enforceRequired: false`. A draft is half written by definition, so refusing
 * it on a blank required question would mean the applicant could not save
 * until they had finished, which is the opposite of what a draft is for.
 * Everything else stays enforced, so a saved draft can never hold a value the
 * submit path would then have to reject.
 *
 * A body naming a stage that is not released, or one already frozen, is
 * REFUSED and names the stage. Silently dropping it is the failure that costs
 * somebody their essay: they type, they watch "Saved" appear, and the box is
 * empty tomorrow.
 *
 * ## Not gated on the maintenance pause, on purpose
 *
 * The pause exists to stop new work landing while something is being fixed.
 * Stranding somebody mid-sentence with an unsaveable form for that helps
 * nobody, and the row already exists, so a save costs one document write. The
 * DEADLINE is a different promise and is enforced: once the window shuts, the
 * form is view-only.
 *
 * ## Access requirements never touch the application row
 *
 * The answer goes to `admissionApplicationPrivate` in the SAME transaction, and
 * the update below cannot write it: the field is not in the object. That is the
 * structural half of the promise the privacy notice makes.
 *
 * ## One transaction, because a save can be in flight when a submit lands
 *
 * The autosave fires on a 120-second timer, so a request that left the browser
 * before the applicant pressed Submit can arrive at the server after the submit
 * committed. Reading the row, deciding it is still a draft, and then writing
 * would let that late save overwrite answers the submit has already frozen and
 * validated with required questions enforced, and nothing anywhere would say so.
 *
 * So the row is re-read INSIDE the transaction and every gate the write depends
 * on is re-checked against that read: the status is still `draft`, and each
 * stage the body names is still unfrozen. The application update and the
 * private-row write commit together or not at all, and a row that moved
 * underneath the request answers 409 saying exactly that.
