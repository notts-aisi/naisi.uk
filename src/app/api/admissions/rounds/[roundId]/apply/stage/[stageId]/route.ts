/**
 * Submit ONE later-released stage, after the first submission has already
 * gone in.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate route rather than a second submit
 *
 * The autumn round releases its questions weekly. Somebody who submitted in
 * week one is `status: "submitted"` when week three's stage opens, so the
 * whole-application submit route (which moves `draft` to `submitted` and moves
 * two counters) is the wrong shape twice over: there is no counter to move,
 * and the stages they already answered are frozen and must stay that way.
 *
 * This route therefore does exactly one thing: it validates and freezes one
 * stage. Counters are untouched, because the person is already counted as
 * submitted; earlier stages are untouched, because a release cannot reopen
 * something already handed in.
 *
 * ## Answers arrive HERE, not through the draft save
 *
 * `PATCH .../apply` refuses once the application leaves `draft`, so a later
 * stage has no server-side draft of its own: it is answered and submitted in
 * one action, and the client keeps the half-written state in the browser until
 * then. That is a deliberate limitation of the contract rather than an
 * oversight, and it is worth knowing before somebody writes a long answer into
 * a stage-two box on a phone. If per-stage drafts are wanted later, the change
 * is to widen the PATCH gate to "this stage is not frozen" rather than "the
 * application is a draft", and nothing here would need to move.
 *
 * Required questions ARE enforced: this is a submit.
