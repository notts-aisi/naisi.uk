/**
 * Submit an application: the one act that turns a private draft into
 * somebody's work in a reviewer's queue.
 *
 * ## One transaction, and it validates what is STORED
 *
 * The submit re-reads the row inside the transaction and validates the answers
 * that are actually on it, with `enforceRequired: true`. It does not take a
 * fresh payload: the client saves first (an explicit PATCH) and then submits,
 * so what gets reviewed is exactly what the applicant last saw the site say it
 * had saved. Accepting answers on this route as well would mean two writers of
 * the same field with different validation contracts, and the version that
 * reached the reviewer would depend on which request landed second.
 *
 * Everything that has to be true at once is inside the one transaction:
 *
 *  - every RELEASED stage passes validation, with required questions enforced
 *    on the parts that are still open and not on one whose own deadline has
 *    gone (see the loop for why);
 *  - each of those stages gets its `stageSubmittedAt` frozen;
 *  - `membershipAtApply` is snapshotted from the user document against the
 *    ROUND's academic year, so the decisions surface shows what was true when
 *    they applied rather than what is true when it is read;
 *  - the round's counters move `draft` down one and `submitted` up one.
 *
 * A counter that drifts is a review queue that lies, and a status that moved
 * without its counter is exactly the drift the `applicationCounts` recount
 * route exists to repair. Doing all four in one transaction is why it should
 * never need to.
 *
 * ## Membership is a badge, never a gate
 *
 * `membershipAtApply` is recorded and shown to the final decider and to
 * admins. No branch here reads it as a condition, and none may: an unpaid
 * applicant is emailed about membership, not refused.
 *
 * ## The receipt is sent AFTER the commit, and cannot fail the submission
 *
 * `admissions-submitted` goes out below the transaction, fire and forget. The
 * send helper swallows everything (suppressed address, SMTP outage, missing
 * template), so the worst case is a courtesy outstanding rather than a
 * submitted application answered with a 500 the applicant reads as "it did not
 * go through". Nothing after the transaction writes a document.
