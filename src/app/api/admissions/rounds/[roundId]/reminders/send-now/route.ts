/**
 * Send this round's due deadline reminders NOW.
 *
 * ## Why the button exists at all
 *
 * The tick is called by an external scheduler and the dates it matters on are
 * named and few. If a tick slips on one of them, this turns a missed deadline
 * reminder into a click.
 *
 * ## It cannot double-send, because it is the SAME handler
 *
 * Not a copy of the job, and not a "send to everyone" escape hatch: it calls
 * `runAdmissionsReminders` with this round's id, so it derives the same due
 * dates from the same round, claims the same markers, and skips anybody the
 * tick has already mailed. Press it twice and the second press sends nothing.
 * A second implementation here would be a second code path through the one
 * thing on this platform that must not double-send.
 *
 * It also honours the same lateness rule, so it cannot be used to mail a
 * "closes in 7 days" reminder a week after the round shut: a due date over
 * `maxLateHours` old is stamped stale and nobody is mailed.
 *
 * ## What it refuses
 *
 *  - a view-as session, first, before anything is read;
 *  - anyone who may not author rounds (admin or `approveCourse`);
 *  - a round that is not open, because a draft round has no applicants and a
 *    closed one has no deadline left to remind anybody about;
 *  - the site-wide scheduler kill switch, which is usually off because
 *    something is actively going wrong;
 *  - the reminders job's OWN switch, which the tick honours too. That job
 *    ships dark (`enabledByDefault: false`), so without this check the manual
 *    lane would be a way to mail a whole round while the job is switched off,
 *    and a way to sidestep a switch an admin turned off on purpose. Turning it
 *    on is one toggle on Site status.
