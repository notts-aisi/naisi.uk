/**
 * `GET /api/admissions/applications/me` - every application the caller has,
 * joined to its round.
 *
 * The same rows `/applications` renders, from the same projection
 * (`buildStatusRow`), so the page and the API can never disagree about what an
 * applicant may see. The page does not fetch this route (it is a server
 * component reading the same loader directly); this exists for the client
 * surfaces that will want it, and as the thing the projection tests can point
 * at as "the wire".
 *
 * ## What is not on the wire
 *
 * Never the stored `email`, never `evidence` (a facilitator's private notes
 * about the applicant), never an unshared `outcome.reason`, never the
 * access-requirements answer. The reasons are written out once, in
 * `statusTypes.ts`, and enforced in one place, `buildStatusRow`.
 *
 * The last of those is structural, not a habit. The session gate comes from
 * `applicantSession.ts`, and the loader behind it takes the collection name
 * from `@/lib/firestore/admissionApplications`, so nothing in this route's
 * import graph is the apply tree's shared context module: that is the module
 * holding the two helpers which address the access-requirements collection on
 * a caller's behalf, and this route must be provably unable to reach them. The
 * privacy scan in `tests/privacy-policy.test.mjs` reads the import list,
 * which is the right thing for it to read, and a source pin in
 * `tests/admissions-status-hub.test.mjs` keeps this route and the loader off
 * that module.
 *
 * ## Not guarded against view-as, and that is the decision
 *
 * Every other applicant-lane route calls `assertNotImpersonating()`. Those all
 * WRITE, or (in `GET .../apply`) join the access-requirements answer, which is
 * health information the privacy notice promises is only read through a route
 * that logs it. This one does neither: it reads status, dates and the person's
 * own answers, which is exactly what "view as" exists to show an admin
 * debugging "my application has vanished". Adding the private join to this
 * route would make the guard necessary; do not add it.
 *
 * A `pending` account is a legitimate caller (`requireApplicant` admits it):
 * somebody who made an account at the fair and applied the same afternoon is
 * still pending on the Monday they come back to check.
