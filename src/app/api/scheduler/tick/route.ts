/**
 * POST /api/scheduler/tick: the ONE scheduler endpoint.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT
 *
 *   SCHEDULER_SECRET   RUNTIME availability only, resolved from Secret
 *                      Manager by name on each backend.
 *
 * The `apphosting.yaml` entry that declares it must look exactly like this:
 *
 *   - variable: SCHEDULER_SECRET
 *     secret: SCHEDULER_SECRET
 *     availability: [RUNTIME]
 *
 * RUNTIME and not BUILD, and no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix: only `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
 * vars are inlined into the client bundle, and a bearer token that reaches a
 * browser is not a bearer token. See docs/courses-ops.md for the Secret
 * Manager and Cloud Scheduler steps that go with it.
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is also required, for the self re-arm below. The host
 * header is NOT usable here: on App Hosting a server component sees the
 * internal Cloud Run revision URL, not the public domain.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHY 404 AND NOT 401. A 401 confirms that the path exists and that the guard
 * is a key check, which is exactly the pair of facts worth knowing before you
 * start guessing. A 404 says nothing. Every rejection here (missing secret,
 * missing header, wrong header) returns the same 404 body.
 *
 * WHY NO RATE LIMIT. The secret is the control, and a limiter in front of it
 * could throttle the one caller that is meant to be there.
 *
 * WHY THE SECRET COMPARISON HASHES FIRST. `timingSafeEqual` THROWS when the
 * two buffers differ in length, so comparing raw bytes would turn a truncated
 * header into a 500, and an error page confirms the endpoint exists, which
 * is the one thing the 404 is for. Hashing both sides to a fixed 32 bytes
 * first makes every comparison well-formed and keeps it constant time.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY. Two layers, and they answer different questions:
 *   - the RECEIPT (`schedulerRuns/tick__{bucket}__d{depth}`) collapses
 *     duplicate EXTERNAL deliveries of the same nominal tick;
 *   - the MARKERS (`schedulerMarkers`) stop the same unit of WORK being done
 *     twice, whatever the tick topology.
 * The receipt dedupe fires only at depth 0. See src/lib/firestore/
 * schedulerRuns.ts for why a depth-blind receipt id was fatal.

/**
 * The ceiling this tick INTENDS to run to. Documentation, not enforcement.

 * whatever this export says, and a killed tick leaves a receipt stuck at
 * "running". So this number is here to state the intent (45s, i.e. 15s of
 * headroom under the platform timeout) and to keep any future host that DOES
 * read it from picking something higher than the platform allows.
 *
 * What keeps a real tick inside that ceiling is `JOB_BUDGET_MS` below. The

 * write, and the re-arm handoff when there is more to do.

/**
 * How long the parent waits for the re-arm child before giving up on it.
 *
 * CLOUD RUN CPU THROTTLING, the reason this is awaited at all: outside a
 * request, an instance's CPU is throttled to near zero. A fire-and-forget
 * `void fetch(...)` after the response has been returned may therefore never
 * get enough CPU to open the socket, and the re-arm silently never happens,
 * the classic "it worked locally" failure. Awaiting keeps the parent's
 * request alive, and therefore its CPU allocated, until the child request has
 * at least been accepted.
 *
 * The trade-off, stated plainly: the child does not respond until it has
 * finished its own work, so the parent cannot wait for it (that would chain
 * four full ticks into one 60s request). It waits `REARM_HANDOFF_MS` and then
 * aborts, which Cloud Run MAY propagate to the child as a client
 * disconnection. If it does, the backlog waits for the next 15-minute
 * delivery, which is safe by construction, because every job derives its due
 * state at tick time and every send is marker-guarded. A dropped re-arm costs
 * latency, never correctness.
 *
 * OVERLAPPING TICKS ARE EXPECTED, and this is where they come from. The
 * parent hands off and stops answering, but the child carries on working, so
 * a chain that starts near the end of a 15-minute bucket is still running
 * when the external scheduler delivers the next one. Nothing prevents that
 * and nothing should: the alternative is a lock, and a lock that outlives a
 * crashed container is how a scheduler goes quiet for a day.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT FALLS OUT OF IT, for anyone writing a job handler: EVERY
 * HANDLER MUST BE SAFE TO RUN CONCURRENTLY WITH ITSELF. Claim before you
 * send, one marker per unit of work, and let the `.create()` decide who owns
 * it. A handler that instead reads a list, does the work and writes a "done"
 * flag at the end will double-send the day two ticks overlap.
