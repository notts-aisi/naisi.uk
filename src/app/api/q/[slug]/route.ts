/**
 * Answers a short link: `naisi.uk/q/<slug>`, reached through the rewrite in
 * `next.config.ts` (`/q/:slug` to `/api/q/:slug`).
 *
 * Under `src/app/api` and behind a rewrite, not at `src/app/q`, so that every
 * guard which walks the API tree walks this too. The slug grammar below
 * (lowercase letters, digits and hyphens only) is this route's own check on
 * the slug, and it runs before the slug is used to address a document.
 *
 * READ-ONLY, and it must stay that way. A GET is fetched by link previews,
 * mail scanners and prefetchers, so a count taken here would count machines.
 * Scans are counted by `POST /api/q/[slug]/scan`, fired by the page the scan
 * lands on. `tests/get-handlers-readonly.test.mjs` fails a GET that calls
 * `recordScan`, and this file must never import it.
 *
 * NEVER takes a destination from the request. There is no `?to=` and there
 * must never be one: that would make `naisi.uk/q/...` a way to bounce
 * somebody to an arbitrary site under a university society's name. The
 * destination comes from the record, validated again on every scan.
 *
 * 307, never 308. A 308 is cached by the phone for good, and the point of a
 * short link is that where it goes can change after it is printed.
 *
 * THE LOCATION IS RELATIVE for a page on this site, and built by hand. Behind
 * the hosting proxy `req.url` carries the internal revision host, so
 * `NextResponse.redirect(new URL(path, req.url))` would send every printed
 * code to an address nobody outside Google can open, while working perfectly
 * on a laptop. A relative `Location` depends on no host at all, and is what
 * the redirects this route replaced sent.
