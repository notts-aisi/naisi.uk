/**
 * A facilitator recording a verdict on one exercise response: a review status
 * and, optionally, feedback the member reads.
 *
 * ── SETTING A STATUS IS WHAT LOCKS THE MEMBER OUT ───────────────────────────
 * There is no separate "locked" flag. The submit route refuses (409) to write
 * any row whose `reviewStatus` is not `"unreviewed"`, so the moment this route
 * writes `seen`, `needs-work` or `approved`, the member's answer becomes
 * read-only — deliberately, so a verdict can't be invalidated by an edit made
 * after it. Setting the status BACK to `"unreviewed"` is the only way to hand
 * editing back, which is exactly how "needs work, have another go" is meant to
 * be run: leave the comment, set `unreviewed`, and the member can revise.
 * `reviewerComment` survives that round trip on purpose — the feedback is what
 * they are revising against.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY REVIEW ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A facilitator of the group the RESPONSE OWNER is placed in ∪ admins. The
 * group is derived server-side from the response's own `runId` + `uid`, so the
 * caller names no group and cannot review across group lines. Admissions
 * reviewers and track leads are NOT here: admissions is a separate lane from
 * the cohort (locked decision), and staffing a run is not facilitating a group.
 *
 * `responseId` is the opaque deterministic doc id carried by the queue payload.
 * It is used VERBATIM as a doc id and NEVER parsed: `runId` can itself contain
 * the `__` separator, so every part is read from the document's fields instead.
 * Deterministic also means GUESSABLE, so the gate below answers "may you?"
 * before it ever answers "does it exist?" — see the access block.
 *
 * PII: `reviewerName` is a display name, never an email.

 * DERIVED FROM `weekId`, never the week doc's own field — so the echo below
 * matches what the queue and the member's own page filter on, and the fallback
 * can never contradict a stored value.
 *
 * Unlike the two list routes, the fallback here is genuinely reachable: this
