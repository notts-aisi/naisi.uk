/**
 * Hide or re-publish one member's public comment. ADMIN ONLY — not
 * facilitators, not track leads: taking down something a member wrote in front
 * of their cohort is a governance act, and the audit stamp it leaves names an
 * accountable person.
 *
 * ── HIDING IS NOT DELETING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `hide` stamps `moderatedByUid` + `moderatedAt` and leaves the comment TEXT
 * in place. The comments route filters stamped rows out of the cohort lane, so
 * the effect is immediate, while the text survives as the audit trail of what
 * was actually taken down. `clear` removes both fields and the comment returns
 * to the lane — which is why the stamp, not a text edit, is the mechanism.
 *
 * The caller is the week page's cohort-notes disclosure, which renders these
 * two actions for admins only. That route serves hidden rows to admins alone
 * (flagged `moderated: true`) precisely so `clear` has something to act on —
 * a lane that hid rows from everyone would make hiding one-way.
 *
 * The member cannot undo either. `courseProgress` is the one client-direct
 * write in this feature, and its rules pin both moderation fields verbatim on
 * every update (and forbid them at create), so re-saving the row cannot
 * fabricate, clear, or launder a stamp — see the collection's module comment.
 * A member who wants the comment gone deletes their own row, which REMOVES the
 * content; that is the moderation outcome, not a way around it.
 *
 * `progressId` is the opaque doc id carried by the comments payload. It is
 * used VERBATIM as a doc id and never parsed: `runId` may itself contain the
 * `__` separator, so the parts are only ever read from the document's fields.
