/**
 * The cohort comment lane for one week — what everyone on the run said about
 * this week's materials, rendered under each material as a disclosure.
 *
 * WHO MAY READ: the same set as the run overview — enrolled members
 * (active or completed) ∪ facilitators ∪ admins. Reviewers and track leads are
 * NOT in it: admissions is a separate lane from the cohort.
 *
 * ── WHY A ROUTE, NOT A CLIENT QUERY ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `courseProgress` is OWN-ROW read in firestore.rules — a member's list query
 * must constrain `uid == self` or it is denied outright. That is deliberate
 * (see the collection's rules block: keeping the read rule `get()`-free is
 * what makes big own-progress lists cheap), and it means cohort-wide progress
 * can only ever reach a member through this route. Everything below is the
 * scoping the rules can't express.
 *
 * `hasPublicComment` exists FOR this query. Firestore cannot filter on field
 * existence, so `courseProgress.ts` maintains a boolean mirror of "publicComment
 * is set and non-empty" — computed in exactly one place (`buildProgressWrite`)
 * and pinned to the actual comment by the rules, so a row can never lie about
 * it and hide from, or leak into, this lane.
 *
 * MODERATION: rows carrying `moderatedByUid` are dropped here for everyone
 * EXCEPT admins, who receive them flagged `moderated: true` — the week page's
 * hide/unhide control is the moderation route's only caller, and it cannot
 * offer "unhide" for a row it never sees. The comment TEXT stays in Firestore
 * as the audit trail — hiding is not deletion — and the rules pin both
 * moderation fields verbatim on every member write, so a member cannot launder
 * a hidden comment back into this payload by re-saving the row.
 *
 * PII: names via `displayNameOf`, never an email. `privateNote` (facilitators
 * and admins only, by design) is not read here at all — this is the public
 * lane, and adding a branch for it would put a private note one boolean away
 * from the whole cohort.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
