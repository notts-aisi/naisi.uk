/**
 * Apply a frozen snapshot's curriculum INTO a run — the "spawn next year's
 * cohort from Autumn 2026 final" half of v2 decision 2.
 *
 * Admin or `approveCourse`: this is the same authority as
 * `/api/courses/runs/[runId]/clone-weeks`, which does the identical job
 * run-to-run, plus the status lane's bar because applying a template is a
 * decision about what a cohort will be taught.
 *
 * ## The copy is id-preserving. That is the platform invariant.
 *
 * Week doc ids ("w01".."w60") and every `material.id` / `exercise.id` /
 * `checklist.id` inside them are carried across verbatim, through the same
 * `templateWeekFields()` the snapshot was written with. Member progress is
 * keyed on those ids — `courseProgress/{runId}__{uid}__{itemId}` and
 * `courseExerciseResponses/{runId}__{uid}__{weekId}__{exerciseId}` — so a copy
 * that re-minted ids would silently orphan every check-off and submission on
 * a re-run of the same material. Nothing in this file may generate an id.
 *
 * ## `replace` never orphans member work — and the gate is a TRANSACTION
 *
 * A run that already has authored weeks is refused (409) unless the caller
 * asks to `replace`. And `replace` itself is refused the moment ANY
 * `courseProgress` or `courseExerciseResponses` row exists for the run:
 * overwriting a week whose materials people have already ticked off and
 * answered would leave their rows pointing at item ids the curriculum no
 * longer contains — work that is still billed to them, invisible to
 * everyone, and unrecoverable without console archaeology.
 *
 * That refusal is deliberately unconditional rather than a warning with a
 * count. Decision 6's "orphaned rows tolerated" governs a facilitator
 * deleting ONE item they can see the cost of; this route would do it to a
 * whole term in one press. The way to replace a curriculum a cohort has
 * started is to make a new run — which is what templates are for.
 *
 * WHY THE WHOLE THING RUNS IN ONE `runTransaction`. `courseProgress` is a
 * DIRECT CLIENT WRITE (rules let an actively enrolled member write their own
 * rows), so a member can tick a checklist item at any moment, and the counts
 * and the week writes have to commit as one unit. Firestore's server-side
 * transactions are serialisable and `tx.get(aggregateQuery)` takes a
 * pessimistic lock on the documents its query matches, so a racing
 * `courseProgress` create either serialises BEFORE the transaction, where the
 * re-check counts it and the whole apply is refused, or AFTER the commit,
 * where the row it creates is keyed on the new curriculum's ids and there is
 * nothing to orphan. There is no third ordering for it to land in.
 *
 * The existing-weeks read is inside the same transaction for the same reason
 * one step out: two admins pressing Copy at the same instant would otherwise
 * both read an empty (or matching) run and both write, interleaving two
 * curricula into one set of week documents. Serialising them costs nothing
 * here — it is the read this route was already doing, moved inside.
 *
 * The SNAPSHOT is read OUTSIDE the transaction on purpose. `courseTemplates`
 * is append-only by construction (rules deny every client write to a template
 * and its weeks, and no route updates one after the save batch), so there is
 * no writer to serialise against and nothing a lock on it would buy — while
 * putting ~60 immutable documents in the read set would make every apply
 * retry on contention it cannot actually have.
 *
 * ## WHAT THE GATE COVERS
 *
 * The gate protects THIS PRESS: the check and the copy are atomic with
 * respect to each other, and that is the whole of the claim. Deleting a
 * run's weeks by hand happens in the WEEK EDITOR, a surface of its own that
 * this route does not see: it counts only the weeks that are there when
 * Apply is pressed. What the editor owes its users belongs to V2-3 decision 6.
 *
 * ## Provenance
 *
 * The run is stamped with `templateId` + `templateLabel` (decision 3), in the
 * SAME transaction as the weeks: the stamp and the content it describes are
 * now atomic, so there is no window where a run claims a provenance whose
 * weeks did not land. Both fields are pinned in `firestore.rules` against
 * every non-admin writer, so the people who edit the curriculum all term
 * cannot rewrite the record of which version they started from.
 * `templateLabel` is a point-in-time copy so the answer survives the snapshot
 * being relabelled or deleted.
 */

/**
 * Ceiling on the documents one apply may write. Firestore's hard limit on a
 * transaction is 500 writes, and this whole operation is now ONE transaction
 * — there is no chunking to fall back on, so an apply that would exceed the
 * limit has to be refused with a sentence rather than fail as a raw 500 half
 * way through. A run holds at most 60 weeks
 * (`COURSE_FIELD_LIMITS.maxWeekPlanEntries`), so the real bound is ~121
 * writes (60 sets + 60 stale deletes + the run doc) and this is unreachable
 * in practice; it exists for the hand-made snapshot that is not.

 * `SubmitError` shape from the exercise-submit route, and the same lane
 * `DestroyPassInFlightError` uses: a refusal is a decision, not a failure,
 * and its sentence has to reach the operator intact.)
