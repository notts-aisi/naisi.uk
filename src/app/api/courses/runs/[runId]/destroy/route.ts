/**
 * DESTROY a course run — the irreversible half of the deletion protocol.
 * The engine (courseDeletion.ts) owns the cascade, its ordering rationale,
 * the audit row, and resumability; this route owns WHO and WHETHER:
 *
 *  - ADMIN ONLY, not approveCourse: the cascade deletes member work
 *    (progress, exercise answers, attendance marks), which is above a
 *    content permission by locked decision. Authorization runs before the
 *    existence check, so non-admins can't enumerate run ids.
 *  - TYPED CONFIRMATION: `confirmName` must equal the run's label EXACTLY —
 *    byte equality, no server-side trimming (whatever normalisation the UI
 *    applies is the UI's business; the server compares what arrives). The
 *    check runs on resume too: the run doc survives until the cascade's
 *    final batch, so the label is still there to hold the admin to.
 *    An UNLABELLED run is refused outright, before the comparison: a
 *    confirmation of "" against "" is a ritual that passes by typing
 *    nothing, which is not a confirmation at all.
 *  - BLOCKERS → 409 with the human sentences from the manifest. The engine
 *    evaluates them (fresh destroys only — a resume must never re-block, or
 *    an interrupted cascade wedges forever).
 *  - ONE PASS AT A TIME → 409: a second invocation arriving while another
 *    holds the audit row's lease is refused rather than allowed to
 *    double-count the same pages into the same totals.
 *
 * RESPONSE CONTRACT: `{ ok, deleted, complete, auditId }`. `deleted` is the
 * audit row's ACCUMULATED totals for this destroy, not just this
 * invocation's page — the client renders it as the running total and a
 * resume may be running in a tab that knows nothing about earlier passes.
 * `complete: false` means the page budget ran out — the client repeats the
 * SAME call (same confirmName) until `complete: true`. The run stays
 * unreachable throughout: the engine's opening transaction set `archived` +
 * `destroying` before anything died, and every discovery surface (catalogue,
 * apply, /me live sections, the learning-space gate) reads them.
