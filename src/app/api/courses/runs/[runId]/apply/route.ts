/**
 * Course run application write API. ALL `courseApplications` writes go through
 * server routes (`allow write: if false` in rules) — the doc carries
 * server-sourced PII (the applicant's email), a paid-membership snapshot, and
 * reviewer-owned decision fields, and the run's status counters have to move in
 * the same transaction. This route is the applicant's third of that surface:
 *
 *   POST   — apply to this run (one per account, structurally)
 *   PATCH  — edit your own application while it is still `pending`
 *   DELETE — withdraw it (soft: the row is kept for audit)
 *
 * Reviewer/admin actions (decide, notes) live under
 * /api/courses/runs/[runId]/applications/… (P5).
 *
 * WHO MAY APPLY (locked product decision): any signed-in user EXCEPT a
 * `rejected` account — `pending` users included. That is deliberate and it is
 * why the apply page lives in the `(public)` route group: `(app)/layout.tsx`
 * bounces `pending` users, so an authed-area page could never host this form.
 *
 * The paid-membership tag is snapshotted here as a BADGE for reviewers. No
 * branch in this file (or any other route) may read it as a gate.
 *
 * A RUN THE APPLICATION FORM PLACES PEOPLE ON TAKES NO APPLICATION HERE. When
 * a programme on a term's application form names this run, people reach it
 * through that form and an admin's hand-over, so POST and PATCH refuse with
 * one sentence, BEFORE the run's own window is read: the run's status and
 * dates do not come into it. A run can only leave draft by way of
 * "applications open", and without this the run a form feeds would take
 * applications nobody is reading for as long as it sat there. DELETE is
 * untouched, because withdrawing takes work off the team and trapping
 * somebody in a queue helps nobody.
 *
 * Shape borrowed wholesale from /api/collaborators/route.ts: session first,
 * rate limits before any datastore work, a deterministic doc id + `.create()`
 * instead of a uniqueness query, a short `updatedAt`-derived edit cooldown, and
 * enumeration-safe error copy.
