 * content, but opening applications or declaring a cohort finished changes
 * what the world sees and what the apply route accepts.
 *
 * The transition table decides WHICH move is legal, and this route is the only
 * status path the admin UI uses.
 *
 * The table lives in `@/lib/courses/runStatus` so the run editor's dropdown is
 * built from the same data and can never offer a move this route refuses.
 *
 * LEAVING DRAFT IS A ONE-WAY DOOR for the week plan, so this route also owns
 * the last check on it. See `draftExitBlocker` below.

 * A reorder in the week plan builder preserves each slot's `weekId` and
 * renumbers positionally, so the plan can say "slot 2 is week 2, document w05"
 * while every member-facing surface opens `weekDocId(2)`. That is reconcilable
 * for free in draft and nowhere else: the normalise route refuses outside
 * draft, and `weekPlanLockRespected()` in firestore.rules pins the plan for
 * non-admins from the same boundary. So a run allowed to leave draft with the
 * two spellings disagreeing has that mismatch frozen into it for the whole of
 * the cohort's life, and every learner opens a different document than the one
 * the admin arranged.
 *
 * The window to fix it is open right up to this call and shut immediately
 * after, which is exactly where the check belongs.
