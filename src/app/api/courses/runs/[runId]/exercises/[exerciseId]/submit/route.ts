/**
 * A member saving or submitting ONE weekly exercise. This route is the only
 * write path to `courseExerciseResponses` — the collection is `allow write: if
 * false` in firestore.rules — and it exists because the two things that make a
 * submission valid are both beyond what rules can express.
 *
 * ── THE RESPONSE-TYPE GATE (why this can't be a client write) ───────────────
 * The exercise DEFINITION on the week doc decides what may be submitted: a
 * `"text"` exercise takes a written answer and rejects a link; a `"link"`
 * exercise takes a URL and rejects prose. Checking that from rules would mean
 * fetching the week doc and searching an array inside a rules expression — and
 * the URL check (`validateSubmissionUrl`) is string parsing rules cannot do at
 * all. So the definition is read here, the type is ASSERTED onto the stored doc
 * from the definition, and a client-sent type is never consulted. The field
 * belonging to the other type is deleted on every write, so an author flipping
 * an exercise from text to link cannot leave a stale answer of the wrong kind
 * behind.
 *
 * WHICH week doc is the MEMBER's, resolved group-first through
 * `groupResolve.ts` (V2-3) — their group's fork when their facilitator has
 * personalised the week, the run canonical otherwise. The validating end and
 * the rendering end must read one document; see the resolution below.
 *
 * ── EDITABLE UNTIL REVIEWED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A row whose `reviewStatus` is anything other than `"unreviewed"` is frozen:
 * this route 409s rather than overwriting it. That is the whole locking
 * mechanism — the review route setting a status IS what locks the member out,
 * and setting the status back to `"unreviewed"` is the only way to hand editing
 * back. Nothing else in the feature keys off a separate "locked" flag.
 *
 * Because the same write that checks the lock also RE-ASSERTS
 * `reviewStatus: "unreviewed"`, the check and the write must be ONE atomic
 * step — see the transaction comment below. A verdict landing between a
 * non-transactional read and its write would be silently undone.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY WRITE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An ACTIVE `learner` enrolment on this run, and nobody else. Facilitators,
 * track leads and admins deliberately cannot submit on anyone's behalf,
 * including their own — a submission is the member's own word, and a route that
 * let staff write one would make the review queue unreadable as evidence. The
 * enrolment is ADDRESSED (`courseEnrolmentId`), never queried, so there is no
 * way to spell another member's row; and the doc id below is built from the
 * caller's own uid, so this route cannot touch anyone else's response.
 *
 * Member content is PLAIN TEXT or a validated URL — typed `string`, never
 * `Block[]`, and rendered as text nodes only by `MemberText`. Nothing here does
 * any HTML processing, and nothing may start.

  // while the field is a re-derived DISPLAY label, so inserting a break can
  // leave doc "w03" carrying `weekNumber: 4`. Storing 4 for a /weeks/3
