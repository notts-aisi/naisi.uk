/**
 * The learning space's one round trip: everything `/learn/[runId]` needs to
 * render — the run, its recomputed current week, the week index the WeekRail
 * draws, the caller's own enrolment, and their group's session card.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY READ (locked product decision) ──────────────────────────────────
 * Enrolled members of the run ∪ its facilitators ∪ admins. Admissions
 * reviewers and TRACK LEADS get 403 unless they also hold one of those:
 * admissions is a separate lane from the cohort, and staffing a run is not
 * membership of it. A track lead who wants the cohort view gets a facilitator
 * enrolment like everyone else. This is the same boundary the applications
 * route states from the other side — reviewing applications grants no access
 * to the cohort, facilitating grants no sight of applications.
 *
 * `completed` enrolments read too: a finished cohort is the member's own
 * history, and nothing here is more sensitive to them than it was on their
 * last active day. Writing is unaffected — the courseProgress rules gate the
 * check-off path on an ACTIVE enrolment, so a completed run is read-only by
 * construction rather than by a flag in this payload.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS ROUTE EXISTS AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `courseGroups` is read-locked to the authoring tier in firestore.rules
 * because group docs carry the MEETING LINK; an enumerable meet link is an
 * open door onto a cohort call. So a member's own group card cannot come from
 * the client SDK — it comes from here, scoped to the one group they belong to,
 * with `meetingUrl` gated separately below.
 *
 * PII: facilitators travel as NAMES only (displayNameOf, never an email), and
 * no other member of the cohort appears in this payload at all.
 *
 * ── V2-3: THIS PAYLOAD IS THE MEMBER'S VIEW, NOT THE RUN'S ──────────────────
 * Per-group autonomy (copy-on-write) means a group can run its own calendar
 * and its own version of individual weeks. `run.startDate`, `run.weekPlan`,
 * `run.totalWeeks`, `currentWeek` and the `weeks` index below are therefore
 * all RESOLVED FOR THE CALLER through `groupResolve.ts` — their group's
 * override when it has one, the run canonical otherwise — rather than being
 * the run document's raw fields.
 *
 * That is deliberate and it is the cheap way to hold THE ONE DESIGN RULE:
 * every surface fed by this route (the run home, the WeekRail, the pacing
 * banner, the week page's session date, the Continue CTA) becomes group-aware
 * without any of them learning that groups can diverge. `calendarSource` says
 * WHICH calendar answered so a surface can disclose it; `forkedWeekIds` says
 * which weeks the caller must read out of their group's subcollection instead
 * of the run's (the client SDK can address either, and `useWeek` picks using
 * exactly this list).
 *
 * A caller with no group — unallocated, an admin, a facilitator of two groups
 * — resolves to the run canonical by construction, because `ownGroup` is null
 * and `resolveCalendar(run, null)` is the run's own calendar.
 *
 * ── ONE CALENDAR PER GROUP, NOT ONE PER CALLER ──────────────────────────────
 * The paragraph above is still true of the TOP-LEVEL fields, and it was once
 * the whole story: the page drew at most one group card, so the caller's
 * calendar and that card's calendar were the same object. They are not the
 * same thing, and a facilitator holding two groups is where the difference
 * shows. Their `ownGroup` is null, so every top-level field resolves to the
 * run canonical, and a card drawn off that would show a group three weeks
 * behind the run its own start date, its own week number and the wrong week's
 * session override, twice, identically, with nothing on the page to say which
 * of the two rooms was being described.
 *
 * So every entry in `groups[]` carries its OWN resolved calendar
 * (`OverviewGroup.calendar`) and every slot field on that entry is resolved
 * through it. `resolveGroupCalendar` is the same helper the singular path
 * uses, called once per group on one clock.
 *
 * `group` (singular) stays NULL for a multi-group facilitator rather than
 * becoming `groups[0]`. `ownGroup` is resolved BEFORE the calendar and that
 * ordering is load-bearing: picking an arbitrary group there would anchor the
 * whole run home, the rail, the pacing banner and the week forks to one of
 * two rooms.
 *
 * ── THE CALLER'S OWN ATTENDANCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `ownAttendance` is a learner's own row out of their group's registers, and
 * it is the only place a member ever sees one. `courseAttendance` stays
 * `read: if false` because one register holds the whole room's marks plus the
 * facilitator's private notes about named students; `ownAttendanceSessions`
 * projects four fields out of each register and copies nothing.
 *
 * GATED ON `pushedAt`, so a register the facilitator is still filling in
 * during the session is invisible here by construction rather than by a flag
 * a later edit could forget.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
