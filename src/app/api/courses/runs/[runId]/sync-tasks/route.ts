/**
 * Lazy task mirroring — projecting the cohort's CURRENT week into the caller's
 * own My Work board as a `tasks/{id}` doc.
 *
 * ── ONE-WAY PROJECTION (the invariant this whole route exists to protect) ────
 * Course progress is the source of truth; the task is a VIEW of it. This route
 * only ever `.create()`s a task. It never updates one, never deletes one, and
 * never reconciles a task back onto course data. Ticking a mirrored subtask in
 * My Work, renaming it, archiving it, or dismissing it writes NOTHING to
 * `courseProgress`, `courseExerciseResponses`, or the week doc — and nothing in
 * the courses feature reads a task back. The arrow points one way, and any
 * future edit that makes a task write influence course state breaks the model:
 * the member's board would become a second, divergent record of what they have
 * done, and the deterministic re-create below would then silently clobber it.
 * If a course surface ever needs "did they do it?", it asks `courseProgress`.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ── WHY LAZY, AND WHY THAT IS SAFE ON EVERY MOUNT ───────────────────────────
 * App Hosting has no scheduler (Cloud Run, 60s request ceiling), so nothing in
 * this app advances a cohort on a timer. Mirroring is therefore driven by page
 * mounts: the learning space and the dashboard POST here, and this route is
 * built to be called that often.
 *
 * The HOT PATH is three doc reads, one Auth RPC, and zero writes: the
 * `getCurrentUser()` session verification runs `verifySessionCookie(cookie,
 * true)` — checkRevoked, so an Admin Auth `getUser` call — plus a `users/{uid}`
 * read, before the enrolment and run reads this route makes itself. The
 * enrolment carries `lastTaskSyncedWeek`, a high-water mark; once it equals the
 * recomputed anchor week, this route returns without reading the week doc or
 * touching `tasks`. Only the first mount of a new cohort week does real work —
 * and callers dedupe per (run, week) for the browsing session on top of that,
 * so the steady state is no request at all rather than a cheap one.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY IS STRUCTURAL, not a check-then-write. The task id is
 * `courseTaskId(runId, weekNumber, uid)` and the write is `.create()`, so two
 * concurrent mounts both aim at the same document: one wins, the other gets
 * ALREADY_EXISTS, which is counted as `alreadyPresent` and is NOT an error.
 * Exactly one task exists afterwards, and neither caller sees a 500. There is
 * no transaction here on purpose — `tx.create` would abort the whole callback
 * on ALREADY_EXISTS, taking the high-water-mark stamp down with it and leaving
 * every subsequent mount to repeat the same doomed work.
 *
 * ── …BUT WHOSE DOCUMENT IS AT THAT ID? ──────────────────────────────────────
 * A task's id says nothing about who made it. ALREADY_EXISTS is therefore not
 * taken on trust: the document is read back and counted as `alreadyPresent`
 * only when it really is this member's mirror (`source: "fellowship-reminder"`
 * and the caller among its completers). Anything else is reported as
 * `conflicted`, LEAVES THE HIGH-WATER MARK UNSTAMPED so the next mount retries,
 * and is logged. Nothing is overwritten or deleted either way; this route
 * still only ever `.create()`s.
 *
 * ── DISMISSAL STICKS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * firestore.rules lets the member delete their own mirror (`source ==
 * 'fellowship-reminder' && isCompleter()`). The high-water mark is what makes
 * that dismissal permanent: `lastTaskSyncedWeek` is already stamped by the time
 * the member can see the card, so the next mount short-circuits rather than
 * resurrecting it. A dismissed week stays dismissed until the cohort rolls into
 * the next one. That is deliberate — a reminder you cannot get rid of is not a
 * reminder, it is nagging.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY CALL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An ACTIVE enrolment on this run, learner or facilitator, and nobody else.
 * There is no admin bypass and there is nothing to bypass TO: the mirror lands
 * on the caller's OWN board, addressed by their own session uid, so an admin
 * with no enrolment has no week of their own to mirror. Every refusal is ONE
 * indistinguishable 403 raised BEFORE the run document is consulted, so a
 * member poking at run ids learns nothing about which ones exist.
 *
 * SERVERS ALWAYS RECOMPUTE. This route reads no body and accepts no week
 * number; the week is derived from `(run, group, now)` by `memberCurrentWeek`.
 * A client cannot ask to have a future week materialised early, nor backfill a
 * term's worth of missed weeks — only the ANCHOR week is ever written.
 *
 * ── V2-3: THE MEMBER'S WEEK, NOT THE RUN'S ──────────────────────────────────
 * Everything above still holds, with one substitution: the week this route
 * mirrors is the caller's OWN — their group's pacing if it has any, and their
 * group's forked copy of that week's content if it has one. Both resolutions
 * go through `groupResolve.ts`, the same helper the week page and the overview
 * use, so a mirrored card can never describe a week the member cannot open.
 *
 * The COST is one extra addressed read (`courseGroups/{id}`) for a member who
 * has been placed, and none at all for one who has not — the group is read
 * only when the enrolment carries a `groupId`. It sits on the hot path because
 * it has to: the short-circuit compares the high-water mark against the
 * member's anchor week, and a group pacing a fortnight behind the run has a
 * different anchor. Comparing against the run's would re-mirror week 5 to a
 * group still on week 3.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY IS UNCHANGED. `courseTaskId(runId, weekNumber, uid)` is already
 * per-member, so two members of two groups on two different weeks aim at two
 * different documents, and the high-water mark lives on the member's own
 * enrolment. Nothing about the guarantee depends on the cohort agreeing about
 * what week it is.

/**
 * `weekNumber: null` means "nothing to mirror" and is a SUCCESS, not a

 *
 * `created`, `alreadyPresent` and `conflicted` are 0-or-1 today (one member,
 * one week) and are counts rather than booleans so an admin-triggered backfill

 *
 * `conflicted: 1` is the honest answer to "something else already occupies this

 * still `ok: true` — there is nothing for the caller to do about it and nothing
 * to show a member mid-page — but it is deliberately NOT `alreadyPresent`,
 * because the week was not in fact delivered and the high-water mark is left
 * unstamped so the next mount tries again.
 *
 * Note that `alreadyPresent: 1` on the short-circuit path is asserted from the
 * high-water mark, not from a read of the task — which is exactly right, since
