/**
 * Decide one application: accept, waitlist, or reject.
 *
 * WHO MAY DECIDE: admins ∪ the run's `admissionsReviewerUids`. Track leads can
 * READ the queue (see the sibling GET route) but not decide it — steering a run
 * and choosing who gets in are different jobs, and the roles route keeps the two
 * arrays apart on purpose. Group facilitators have no standing here at all.
 *
 * DECIDING DOES NOT ENROL ANYONE. There is deliberately no `courseEnrolments`
 * write in this file: allocation (P6) is the step that places accepted
 * applicants into groups, and it owns the no-double-placement invariant (one
 * enrolment doc per (run, uid), a single scalar `groupId`). An "accepted"
 * application is an offer, not a seat — which is also why the accepted email
 * promises a later placement email rather than a group.
 *
 * The paid-membership tag is a badge for the reviewer's judgement and is not
 * read anywhere in this file. Nothing may gate a decision on it.
