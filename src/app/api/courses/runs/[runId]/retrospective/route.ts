/**
 * THE RETROSPECTIVE — per-material evidence for one run (v2 decision 3): how
 * the cohort rated each piece of material, how many finished it, and what the
 * facilitators wrote about how it landed.
 *
 * WHO MAY READ: admins ∪ `approveCourse` ∪ `draftCourse` ∪ this run's track
 * leads. The people who author and steer curricula, which is the entire point
 * — this view exists to be read while drafting the next version.
 *
 * ── THE ANONYMITY BOUNDARY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * RATINGS ARE ANONYMOUS AGGREGATES. Members rate materials from inside their
 * own progress rows on the understanding that nobody is reading their score
 * as theirs, and the audience for this view is exactly the facilitators and
 * leads who could put a name to a number in a group of eight. So:
 *
 *  - not one uid, name or email of a RATER crosses this boundary. The
 *    aggregation receives a field-masked projection (`itemId`, `rating`,
 *    `completed`) and returns counts;
 *  - `avgRating` is WITHHELD below `RETRO_ANONYMITY_FLOOR` ratings — with one
 *    or two scores an average is invertible by anyone who knows who did the
 *    reading. The count is still shown, because "2 ratings, no average yet"
 *    identifies nobody and is the honest reason the number is missing;
 *  - the ONLY names in the payload belong to FACILITATORS, on notes they
 *    wrote in their staff capacity and signed.
 *
 * Every field added below must be checked against that line. If a future
 * version wants "who hasn't finished week 3", it is a different route with a
 * different tier — not a column here.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ## Read cost
 *
 * ONE query per collection for the whole run — progress (field-masked,
 * capped), notes (capped), the run's weeks — plus one count aggregation for
 * the enrolment denominator. Everything is grouped in memory by
 * `aggregateRetrospective`. There is deliberately no per-material and no
 * per-member query: a 12-week course with 10 items a week would be 120 round
 * trips per page view. Past `RETRO_PROGRESS_LIMIT` rows the payload says
 * `truncated: true` rather than averaging a prefix and calling it the cohort.
 *
 * All filters are single equalities on `runId` (automatic single-field index)
 * or an equality pair served by index merging. No composite index was added.
