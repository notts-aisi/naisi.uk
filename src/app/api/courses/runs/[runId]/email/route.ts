/**
 * EMAIL THE COHORT — the announcement lane. One message to everyone on a run:
 * "applications for term two open Monday", "the week 4 reading has changed".
 * The group email route is its operational twin; the two differ in who may
 * send, who receives, and — the part that matters legally — whether the
 * recipient can opt out.
 *
 * ── ONE MESSAGE PER RECIPIENT. NOT NEGOTIABLE. ──────────────────────────────
 * The dispatch at the bottom sends ONE `sendEmail` per address with a single
 * string `to`. Never an array, never a Cc. A cohort is up to 200 people; one
 * batched envelope would hand all 200 addresses to all 200 people. Sends run
 * through `dispatchSends`, which bounds how many are in flight and carries the
 * arithmetic that keeps a full-size send inside App Hosting's 60s request
 * timeout — a broadcast that outlives the request has already spent its
 * rate-limit slot and can only be retried by re-mailing everyone.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY SEND, AND WHO RECEIVES: BOTH LIVE IN THE SHARED MODULE ──────────
 * `gateRunStaff` and `resolveCohortAudience` in
 * `src/lib/email/courseFacilitatorEmails.ts` own the run-staff predicate and the
 * subscription ∩ active-enrolment audience, including the guest-row drop, the
 * `courses` category opt-out, suppression, and the recipient cap that REFUSES
 * rather than truncates. Both carry the full argument in their own headers.
 *
 * They are shared with P11's weekly nudge because a nudge IS an announcement to
 * the whole run: the two lanes must agree on who may speak for a cohort and who
 * is in it, and they used to agree by being written out twice.
 *
 * ── THE 200 CAP FAILS THE REQUEST ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * `MAX_COHORT_RECIPIENTS` refuses rather than truncates. A partial cohort send
 * is the worst outcome available: it looks successful, and nobody can tell which
 * 200 of the 260 got the mail — least of all on a second attempt, which would
 * re-mail the same first 200. A run that outgrows the cap needs a chunked sender
 * with per-recipient bookkeeping, which is a different feature.
 *
 * ── TWO LANES IN ONE ROUTE: `asNotice` ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The body may carry `asNotice: true`, which the composer offers as a tick. It
 * changes the CLASS of the send, and only that:
 *
 *  - WITHOUT it (the default, and every send before this flag existed), this is
 *    the GRID class on the `courses` row. `resolveCohortAudience` drops anybody
 *    whose row is a stored `false` before a message is rendered, the mail
 *    carries the unsubscribe footer and the RFC 8058 headers, and it does not
 *    push. An announcement is opt-outable and stays so.
 *  - WITH it, this is the NOTICE class. The audience is everyone on the cohort
 *    LIST whatever the `courses` row says, the send goes through `sendNotice`
 *    (so it carries the marker line and a `kind: "notice"` receipt with
 *    `surface: "course-run"`), there is no unsubscribe affordance because there
 *    is nothing to unsubscribe from, and every recipient with a device is
 *    pushed.
 *
 * What does NOT change: the gate (the same run staff), the enrolment
 * re-verification, the guest-row drop, the 200-recipient refusal and the
 * suppression list. A notice may bypass what somebody chose; never who they
 * are, nor whether their address bounces.
 *
 * AND IT DOES NOT REACH SOMEBODY WHO LEFT THE COHORT LIST. `ignoreCategoryOptOut`
 * relaxes the `courses` row and nothing else: the audience is still the
 * subscription channel, so a member who clicked the unsubscribe link in an
 * earlier announcement is not in it. That is the audience rule
 * `resolveCohortAudience` argues for at length and it is not this flag's to
 * overturn, but it must not be invisible either, so the response carries
 * `unreachable`: how many ACTIVE members of the run are off the list. The
 * composer prints it, and the tick's own copy says the list is what it reaches.
 *
 * A TEST SEND IS NEVER A NOTICE. `testOnly` reaches the sender's own address
 * and nobody else, so nobody's preference is bypassed and the marker's sentence
 * would be false about it; `testOnly` wins over `asNotice` and the rehearsal
 * goes out on the ordinary lane, marked `[TEST]`, as it always has.
