/**
 * Copy-forward: clone one run's `weeks` subcollection into another run of the
 * SAME course.
 *
 * ## Where this sits now (updated in V2-2 — the old rule here was abandoned)
 *
 * This comment used to argue that there was deliberately NO curriculum
 * template collection, and that a course's most recent run WAS the master
 * copy. That is no longer the design and must not be read as guidance:
 * `courseTemplates` exists (v2 decision 2) as append-only frozen SNAPSHOTS —
 * a saved iteration is what a finished cohort was actually taught, and it
 * cannot be edited afterwards, which is exactly the property a live run
 * cannot offer. `POST /api/courses/runs/[runId]/apply-template` is the
 * template-shaped counterpart of this route.
 *
 * Copy-forward SURVIVES alongside it, deliberately, because the two answer
 * different questions:
 *
 *  - a TEMPLATE answers "start next year from the version we agreed was
 *    finished", and carries its retrospective evidence with it;
 *  - THIS ROUTE answers "start from what that other delivery has right now",
 *    which is what an author wants mid-term, between snapshots, or when the
 *    run worth copying was never frozen.
 *
 * The old objection — a third place curriculum can live — is answered by
 * making every copy go through ONE id-preserving shape
 * (`templateWeekFields()`, which both directions of the snapshot copy and the
 * apply route also use) rather than by refusing to have a second place. Note
 * the one real difference in behaviour: `apply-template` REMOVES target weeks
 * its snapshot has no counterpart for, and refuses outright while any member
 * work exists on the run; this route only skips or overwrites and has no such
 * gate. A caller choosing between them is choosing between those guarantees.
 *
 * Two properties make this route safe to press twice:
 *
 *  - **Id-preserving.** Week doc ids ("w01".."w60") are copied verbatim, and so
 *    is every `material.id` / `exercise.id` / `checklist.id` inside them.
 *    Member progress is keyed on those ids — `courseProgress/{runId}__{uid}__
 *    {itemId}` and `courseExerciseResponses/{runId}__{uid}__{weekId}__
 *    {exerciseId}` — so a copy that re-minted ids would silently orphan every
 *    check-off and submission on a re-run of the same material. Nothing here
 *    may generate an id.
 *  - **Idempotent.** A week id that already exists in the target is skipped
 *    unless the caller asks to overwrite, so re-running the copy after
 *    authoring three weeks by hand doesn't wipe them.
 */

/**
 * Writes per batch. Firestore's hard limit is 500; 300 leaves headroom and a
 * run can hold at most 60 weeks (`maxWeekPlanEntries`), so in practice this
 * commits once — the chunking is here so a future longer-form course can't
 * turn into a 500-write failure.
