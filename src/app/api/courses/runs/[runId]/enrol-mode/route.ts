/**
 * Move a run between `admissions` (apply, be reviewed, be allocated) and
 * `open` (everyone who signs up gets a place). The ONLY writer of
 * `courseRuns.enrolMode`; the rules birth-pin the field to "admissions" and
 * pin it unchanged on every client-direct update.
 *
 * ADMIN ONLY, and deliberately a tighter gate than the status route's
 * "admin or approveCourse". Opening a run changes what the enrol route will
 * ACCEPT: it admits an enrolment with no application behind it, which is a
 * write door rather than a lifecycle step. Approving curriculum and opening a
 * door are different powers, and the second one belongs to the smaller set.
 *
 * REFUSES ONCE ANYBODY IS ON THE RUN, in either direction, and that refusal
 * is the whole safety story:
 *
 *  - open -> admissions with people already self-enrolled would leave a
 *    cohort of enrolments with no application rows, on a run whose every
 *    admissions surface (the queue, the allocation board, the decide route)
 *    reads applications. Those members would be invisible to staff while
 *    still receiving the cohort's mail.
 *  - admissions -> open with applications pending would leave real people
 *    waiting on a decision from a review process the run no longer has, and
 *    the pending counter would never be decremented by anything.
 *
 * There is no reconciliation for either, so the route refuses rather than
 * offering a repair it cannot perform. An admin who genuinely needs to
 * change a populated run's mode removes the enrolments (or decides the
 * applications) first, which is exactly the accounting the refusal is asking
 * for.
 *
 * IT ALSO REFUSES TO OPEN A RUN WHOSE GROUPS ARE NOT CAPPED, and that check
 * is not tidiness. `groupCapacityOk()` in firestore.rules requires a
 * capacity in [1, 40] on every group whose parent run is `open`, and it is
 * evaluated against the MERGED document on an update, so a group that was
 * legal while the run was in admissions mode becomes unwritable the instant
 * the run flips: the facilitator who tries to move the room gets a raw
 * permission-denied, with nothing on the group or the run to explain it.
 * Flipping the run is the one write that can wedge a document it does not
 * touch, so it is the one write that has to look first.
 *
 * Every accepted change writes a `courseAudit` row before it returns: the
 * field is invisible on most surfaces and a silent flip is how a run ends up
 * in a mode nobody remembers choosing.
