/**
 * THE WEEK NUDGE — "a new week of the course is live, here's what's in it".
 *
 * ── V3: THIS IS NOW THE ADMIN CATCH-UP LANE ─────────────────────────────────
 * The weekly reminder is sent by a facilitator pressing PUSH ATTENDANCE
 * (`/api/courses/groups/[groupId]/attendance/push`), per group, keyed on that
 * group's next session. What is left here is the catch-up, and it is
 * ADMIN-ONLY for real sends:
 *
 *   · THE SESSION-1 WELCOME. No push exists before a run's first session, so
 *     nothing in the group lane can produce it. An admin sends it from here.
 *   · RECOVERY. A push locks its register and rebuilds the mirrors BEFORE it
 *     mails anybody, precisely so a send failure leaves the record correct and
 *     the mail owed. This lane, with `force`, is how that mail is recovered.
 *
 * It therefore reads the group lane's `gnudge__` markers before it sends and
 * treats them as this calendar week's claim: refused without `force`, and
 * RECORDED into its own marker with it, exactly as a neighbouring `nudge__`
 * marker is. A run facilitator keeps the GET preview and the test send.
 *
 * ── A PREPARED SEND, NOT A SCHEDULED ONE (the shape of this whole route) ────
 * App Hosting is Cloud Run with a 60s request ceiling and NO SCHEDULER, so a
 * nudge cannot fire itself. Everything else in the courses feature is paced
 * lazily off page mounts (see the task mirror in `sync-tasks`), but mail is not
 * a thing you may send on a stranger's page mount: whoever's browser happens to
 * load the run home first would be the one who mailed 200 people.
 *
 * So the nudge is HUMAN-TRIGGERED: a facilitator or admin opens the composer,
 * reads the GET preview (what it will say, who it will reach), and sends this
 * week's nudge with one click from the pre-filled template.
 *
 * ── …BUILT TO BE CRONNED LATER WITHOUT A CODE CHANGE ────────────────────────
 * The endpoint is IDEMPOTENT PER (run, calendar week). Point a daily Cloud
 * Scheduler job or a GitHub Action at `POST /api/courses/runs/{runId}/nudge` and
 * it sends exactly ONCE per cohort week: the first tick after the week rolls
 * sends, and every tick after that returns `{ ok: true, alreadySent: true,
 * sent: 0 }` having done THREE ADDRESSED READS AND NO QUERY — the run (the auth
 * gate), the week (is there anything to nudge about), and one batched `getAll`
 * of the thirteen marker ids that could hold this week's claim. That property is
 * deliberate and load-bearing — design changes here must preserve it. Three
 * things make it work:
 *
 *   1. The cohort's position is RECOMPUTED server-side from `(run, now)` — the
 *      route reads no week number from anybody, so a cron with no idea what week
 *      it is asks the right question by asking nothing.
 *   2. The marker claim is a `.create()` at a DETERMINISTIC id keyed on the
 *      CALENDAR SLOT (`nudgeMarkerId`, whose header carries the full argument),
 *      so two ticks racing each other cannot both send — and neither can a track
 *      lead renumbering the week plan mid-week. An edit to the run's `startDate`
 *      moves the slot itself and would mint a fresh id for the same calendar
 *      week; `nudgeWeekMarkerIds` closes that by treating any marker within ±6
 *      days as this week's.
 *   3. The body is OPTIONAL. A cron POSTing with no body at all is a valid
 *      "send this week's nudge" — `{}` is the default.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT built: the scheduler itself, and any machine
 * identity for it. The auth gate below is unchanged and a future cron will have
 * to present a real session (or whatever `getCurrentUser()` grows to accept).
 * Wiring one up is a config job plus an identity decision, not a rewrite.
 *
 * ── IDEMPOTENCY: CLAIM FIRST, THEN SEND ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Before dispatching, the route `.create()`s the marker. Deterministic id +
 * `.create()` IS the guarantee — the same structural trick the task mirror uses
 * — and it is claimed BEFORE the first message goes out, never after.
 *
 * THAT ORDERING TRADES "POSSIBLE PARTIAL SEND" FOR "NEVER A DUPLICATE BLAST",
 * which is the right trade for email. If the container dies half way through a
 * 200-person cohort, the marker already exists: the next cron tick sends
 * nothing, and some of the cohort missed that week's nudge. The alternative —
 * stamp after a successful loop — would mean a crash at recipient 190 re-mails
 * the first 189 on the next tick, forever, until someone notices. A missed
 * nudge is a nudge; a duplicate blast is an incident. `force` (below) is the
 * escape hatch for the rare case where the partial send needs finishing, and it
 * is auditable rather than silent.
 *
 * `force: true` is ADMIN-ONLY and does not erase the marker: it records who
 * forced, when, and how many times it has been forced, so a second send to a
 * cohort is always visible on the record afterwards. A force over a NEIGHBOURING
 * marker — the `startDate`-edit case, where the claim this send collides with
 * lives under a different id — cannot be recorded by the `.create()` failing,
 * so the neighbour it overrode is written INTO the new marker instead
 * (`forcedOverMarkerId`, and `forceCount` starting at 1). A cohort mailed twice
 * in one calendar week is on the record either way.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY SEND, AND WHO RECEIVES ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `gateRunStaff` and `resolveCohortAudience` in
 * `src/lib/email/courseFacilitatorEmails.ts`, the SAME two functions the P9
 * cohort announcement route calls. That sharing is the point: a nudge is an
 * announcement to the whole run, so facilitating one GROUP of it is not enough
 * (a group facilitator mails their own room through the group route), and the
 * audience is the cohort subscription channel INTERSECTED with an ACTIVE
 * enrolment, opt-out honoured, suppression filtered, capped with a refusal
 * rather than a truncation. Both derivations used to be written out twice, once
 * per route, under a comment saying "IF YOU CHANGE ONE, CHANGE BOTH"; they are
 * now written once.
 *
 * ── V2-3: THE RUN'S CADENCE DECIDES *WHEN*, THE RECIPIENT'S GROUP DECIDES
 *    *WHAT* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Groups can now pace themselves and fork individual weeks (copy-on-write), so
 * one send can legitimately carry several different weeks. The split is:
 *
 *   TRIGGER + IDEMPOTENCY stay RUN-LEVEL. `resolveNudgeWeek` still asks the
 *   RUN where it is, the marker is still keyed on the RUN's calendar slot, and
 *   `NudgeSendResult.weekNumber` is still the run's week. A group pacing three
 *   weeks behind therefore still gets nudged on the RUN's cadence — that is a
 *   DELIBERATE, OWNER-VISIBLE decision, not an oversight. Making the marker
 *   per-group would mean a cohort of twelve groups needs twelve claims, twelve
 *   sends and twelve chances to double-mail, and it would silence a group
 *   whose calendar has run out entirely. One send, one claim, one record.
 *
 *   CONTENT is resolved PER RECIPIENT through `groupResolve.ts`: their group's
 *   current week number, its title, its summary, its prep line, its URL, and
 *   the session date computed from THEIR group's slot. Two members of the same
 *   cohort in different groups can receive genuinely different emails from one
 *   click, which is the point of per-group autonomy.
 *
 *   THE FALLBACK IS THE RUN'S WEEK, and it is used whenever a group's own week
 *   cannot be nudged about: their calendar is on a break, has not started, has
 *   finished, is half-authored, or their week is unauthored/unpublished. The
 *   run's week is the thing the send is already claiming, and it is by
 *   definition published (the gate proved it). Silence is not an option here —
 *   the recipient is on a send that has already been claimed, so "no email"
 *   would mean that member simply never hears about that week at all.
 *
 * NOTE the deliberate asymmetry with the SESSION fallback below: an unresolved
 * group gets the RUN's week (shared curriculum, safe) but NEVER another
 * group's session time (a room they must not turn up to). Content degrades to
 * the cohort's; logistics degrade to silence.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT SAYS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `src/lib/email/courseNudgeEmail.ts` owns every word of it: template
 * resolution, the token map, the escaping, the drop-the-sentence degradation
 * rule, and the render through `CourseNudgeEmail` (which carries the visible
 * unsubscribe line to pair with the RFC 8058 headers). THIS ROUTE BUILDS NO
 * COPY. It resolves the facts a nudge is about — which week, which session,
 * which link — and hands them over. Anything token-shaped added here instead of
 * there is a second implementation, and the first thing a second implementation
 * does is stop resolving a token the template uses.

/**
 * GET — what the nudge WOULD say and who it WOULD reach, so a sender can read
 * it before committing.
 *
 * `week: null` means there is nothing to nudge about (the run has not started,
 * has finished, sits on a break, or this week is unauthored/unpublished). It is
 * a SUCCESS, not a failure, and the human reason travels in `bodyPreview` with
 * `subjectPreview` empty — the surface shows the reason where the copy would
 * be, and `week === null` is the machine-readable half.
 *
 * `recipients` is a COUNT and never addresses. It is the post-opt-out,
 * post-suppression number — i.e. what `sent` should come back as — except when
 * the cohort is over the recipient cap, where it is the enrolled count so the
 * surface can say "260 recipients, over the 200 limit" before POST refuses.
 *
 * `alreadySentAt` is the claim time of the marker holding this calendar week
 * (ISO), or null when this week's nudge has not gone out — and always null when
 * `week` is null, since the marker is per (run, slot) and there is no slot to
 * nudge about. It reads the same ±6-day span POST refuses on
 * (`findWeekMarker`), so a `startDate` edit cannot make a week the cohort has
 * already been mailed show here as unsent.
 *
 * `sessionLine` is what the session sentence resolves to IN THIS PREVIEW — the
 * reader's own group's slot for this week if they hold a placement on the run,
 * else the line every active group shares, else null. Real recipients each get
 * their OWN group's line by the same rule (`groupContextFor`).
 *
 * V2-3 — `week` IS THE RUN'S WEEK, THE PREVIEW COPY IS THE SENDER'S. `week`
 * names what this send CLAIMS: the run's slot, which is what the marker is
 * keyed on and what "already sent" is a fact about. `subjectPreview` and
 * `bodyPreview` are the sender's own rehearsal and resolve their group's week
 * (title, number, link) exactly as their test send will. A facilitator whose
 * group is paced apart from the run therefore sees a body naming a different
 * week from `week.weekNumber` — that is not a bug and must not be "fixed" by
 * making the two agree: one is the cohort's claim, the other is one person's
 * copy, and a preview that hid the difference would hide the divergence the
 * sender most needs to notice before pressing send.
