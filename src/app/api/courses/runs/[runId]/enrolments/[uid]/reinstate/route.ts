/**
 * Put a member who left an open-enrolment run back on it: their `withdrawn`
 * row flips to `active` and the two counters it was holding go back up, in
 * one transaction.
 *
 * WHO MAY REINSTATE: admins and the run's `trackLeadUids`, the same gate the
 * remove route uses. Reinstating is the exact inverse of removing, so it
 * belongs to the same people.
 *
 * ## Why this route had to exist
 *
 * The drop-out copy tells a member "the team can put you back on", and the
 * enrol route's own comment used to say staff do that through the allocation
 * board. They cannot: `allocate` refuses any uid whose `courseApplications`
 * row is not `accepted` (the `not-accepted` rejection), and a self-enrolled
 * member never had an application at all. So the one repair the member was
 * pointed at was the one repair the codebase could not perform.
 *
 * ## What it will not do
 *
 * SELF-ENROLLED, WITHDRAWN ROWS ONLY, and their own group.
 *
 *  - A `removed` row is staff's own decision, made on the board, and undone
 *    there: for an admissions learner that is the allocate route, which knows
 *    how to re-place them against their accepted application.
 *  - An allocated learner's row (`selfEnrolled` false) is not this route's
 *    business either, for the same reason and because `enrolledCount` never
 *    counted them, so re-incrementing it here would inflate a number the
 *    enrol-mode route reads.
 *  - The seat comes back in the session they left, which the withdrawn row
 *    still names (the drop keeps `groupId` precisely so a facilitator can see
 *    who left their session). Moving them somewhere else afterwards is the
 *    member's own "change session", or the allocation board's job.
 *
 * CAPACITY IS HARD. Somebody else may well have taken the seat in the
 * meantime, and quietly putting a 13th person in a room of 12 is how a
 * register hits `ATTENDANCE_LIMITS.maxRecords` and fails a bulk mark for the
 * whole group. The refusal names the group and is a sentence.
 *
 * NO AUDIT ROW, deliberately, and for the reason the enrol route gives for
 * joining: `CourseAuditKind` has no member for reinstatement, and inventing a
 * string would land in the log as "Unrecognised action". The enrolment
 * document carries the change (status, cleared drop-out stamp, `updatedAt`),
 * and the `enrolment-dropout` row it reverses is still in the log.
