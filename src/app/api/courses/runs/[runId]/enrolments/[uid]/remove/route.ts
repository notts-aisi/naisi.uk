/**
 * Remove one learner from a run: their enrolment flips to `status:"removed"`
 * and its `groupId` clears, releasing the seat, in one transaction with the
 * group's `memberCount` decrement.
 *
 * WHO MAY REMOVE: admins ∪ the run's `trackLeadUids` — the allocation gate.
 *
 * A SOFT removal, deliberately: the enrolment doc survives. The deterministic
 * doc id (`courseEnrolments/{runId}__{uid}`) is the one-enrolment-per-(run,
 * uid) invariant, so the row is that person's entire history on the run:
 * deleting it would let a later re-placement mint a "fresh" enrolment with no
 * memory. Re-admission is the allocate route flipping this same row back to
 * "active" (which also re-clears/re-earns the placement-email stamp via the
 * cleared `groupId`). That route needs an accepted application, so a member
 * who signed themselves up comes back through the reinstate route instead.
 *
 * FACILITATOR ROWS ARE OUT OF SCOPE: a `role:"facilitator"` enrolment is
 * managed by the group facilitators route (which retires it when the person
 * is unassigned). Refused here so the board can't quietly strip someone's
 * facilitator access under the guise of un-placing a learner.
