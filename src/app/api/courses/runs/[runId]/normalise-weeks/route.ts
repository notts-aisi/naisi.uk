/**
 * Re-address a DRAFT run's weeks so the plan's `weekId` and the doc id every
 * member-facing surface derives (`weekDocId(weekNumber)`) are the same string
 * again.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `WeekPlanBuilder.renumber()` renumbers positionally and
 * deliberately preserves `weekId`, so moving a slot leaves the plan saying
 * "slot 2 is week 2, document w05" while every reader of that cohort opens
 * `weekDocId(2)` = `w02`. Admin surfaces follow the plan, members follow the
 * number, and the two quietly disagree from the first press of the up arrow.
 *
 * WHY AT THE DRAFT BOUNDARY. The preserved id is not a mistake: once a cohort
 * is live it is what keeps authored curriculum and everyone's saved work
 * attached to the same slot across a renumber, and repointing it would move
 * real progress under real people. In DRAFT none of that exists yet, so the
 * two spellings can be reconciled for free. That is the whole design of this
 * route: it is not a general repair tool, it is the one window where the
 * repair is free, and it refuses to run outside it.
 *
 * The companion half is `weekPlanLockRespected()` in firestore.rules, which
 * pins `weekPlan` for non-admins once a run leaves draft, so a plan that
 * leaves this window canonical stays canonical unless an admin deliberately
 * reshapes it.
 *
 * REFUSALS, all 409 with a sentence the admin can act on:
 *  - the run is not a draft;
 *  - any `courseProgress` or `courseExerciseResponses` row exists for the run
 *    (belt and braces: in draft there should be none, and if there are, the
 *    "moving repoints nothing" premise is false);
 *  - a group of this run has forked weeks or per-week session overrides, both
 *    of which are keyed by week doc id and would strand;
 *  - a week document exists that the plan does not reference and it sits on an
 *    id the move needs, which would clobber authored content.
