/**
 * "How did this land" — one facilitator's note on one piece of material, for
 * one run. The FACILITATOR half of the retrospective loop (v2 decision 3);
 * the anonymous ratings half comes out of `courseProgress`.
 *
 * WHO MAY WRITE: admins ∪ this run's track leads ∪ its `runFacilitatorUids`
 * ∪ anyone facilitating ANY GROUP in the run. The last clause is why this is
 * a route and not a rule: "facilitator of some group in this run" is a query
 * over `courseGroups`, and Firestore rules cannot run one.
 *
 * Refusals are a single indistinguishable 403 — a caller who is none of the
 * above learns nothing about whether the run exists.
 *
 * ## Two things the client does not get to decide
 *
 *  - **`weekNumber` is server-derived.** The route locates the week doc whose
 *    `materials` actually contain `itemId` and stores THAT week's number. A
 *    client-chosen number could file a note against a week the material is
 *    not in, where the retrospective — which builds its rows from the current
 *    week definitions — would never render it. A note silently lost is worse
 *    than a note refused, so an unknown `itemId` is a 400.
 *
 * ## Where it looks for that material (V2-3: GROUP-FIRST)
 *
 * A group's forked week is that group's curriculum, and a facilitator writing
 * "how did this land" about a reading THEY swapped in is the exact lane this
 * route exists for. Scanning only `courseRuns/{runId}/weeks` refused those
 * notes with "that material isn't in this run's curriculum" — a sentence that
 * was, from the facilitator's side, simply untrue.
 *
 * So the scan is ordered, and stops at the first week holding the id:
 *
 *   1. THE ACTOR'S OWN GROUPS' forks — group-first, and for a plain
 *      facilitator this is the only place their own swap-ins live. Usually one
 *      collection read, because a facilitator staffs one room.
 *   2. THE RUN CANONICAL — where the overwhelming majority of materials are.
 *   3. EVERY OTHER GROUP'S forks, for admins / track leads / run facilitators
 *      ONLY. "Leads may note any group's fork" is the decision; a plain
 *      facilitator gets no reach into a room they do not staff, which is the
 *      same boundary the review queue draws. Bounded by `MAX_GROUPS_SCANNED`
 *      and reached only when the first two missed.
 *
 * A fork preserves ids AND its week doc id (`templateWeekFields`), so a
 * material present in both a fork and the canonical resolves to the same
 * `weekNumber` either way — the ordering matters for materials that exist in
 * exactly one of them, which is the case that was broken.
 *  - **`byName` is resolved from the author's user doc**, never taken from
 *    the body, and it is a DISPLAY NAME: the retrospective is the one place a
 *    name appears, and it must be a name, never an address.
 *
 * Materials only. Checklist items are the member's own to-do projection (they
 * mirror into My Work), not curriculum whose quality is under review — the
 * retrospective has no row for one, so a note on one would be unreachable.
 *
 * An empty note CLEARS the row rather than storing an empty string: the doc
 * id is `(run, item, author)`, so "delete my note" is the natural meaning of
 * saving a blank one, and an empty note in the collection would render as a
 * ghost line in every future retrospective.
