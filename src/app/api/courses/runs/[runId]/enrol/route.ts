/**
 * OPEN ENROLMENT: clicking into a pre-course session slot, and leaving again.
 *
 *   GET:    the session slots on offer plus the caller's own row (if any)
 *   POST:   take a seat in one of them
 *   PATCH:  move to a different session, or change stream
 *   DELETE: drop out. IRREVERSIBLE.
 *
 * ── WHY A ROUTE AND NOT A CLIENT-DIRECT WRITE ───────────────────────────────
 * `courseEnrolments` is `allow write: if false` and it stays that way. Three
 * of this route's invariants cannot be expressed in a rule at all: the group's
 * `memberCount` and the run's `enrolledCount` must move in the SAME
 * transaction as the row (a counter that drifts is a seat count that lies), the
 * capacity check has to read that counter transactionally so two people
 * clicking at once cannot both take the last place, and `joinedWeekNumber` is
 * resolved against the TARGET GROUP's calendar, which means reading a second
 * document.
 *
 * ── THE DETERMINISTIC ID IS THE WHOLE UNIQUENESS STORY ───────────────────────
 * One enrolment per (run, uid) exists structurally: `tx.create` at
 * `courseEnrolmentId(runId, uid)` throws ALREADY_EXISTS rather than minting a
 * second row, so nothing here queries "are they already on this run".
 *
 * A consequence worth stating out loud: because the row survives a drop-out,
 * SELF RE-ENROLMENT AFTER DROPPING OUT IS IMPOSSIBLE, and that is the decision
 * ("irreversible: it frees the seat and stops the nudges, and coming back is a
 * new enrolment rather than an undo"). Staff can put somebody back through
 * POST .../enrolments/[uid]/reinstate, which flips this same row to active
 * and gives the two counters back. NOT through the allocation board: that
 * route refuses any uid whose application is not `accepted`, and a
 * self-enrolled member never had an application at all.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY ENROL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Any signed-in account EXCEPT a `rejected` one, `pending` included. That is
 * the same gate the apply route uses and it is deliberate: the pre-course
 * opens during Welcome Week, when every fresher who has just registered is
 * still `pending`. (Their access to /learn afterwards is a separate change,
 * which is why the confirmation copy here does not promise it.)
 *
 * ── RATE LIMITS BEFORE THE READS ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The per-IP limit is taken before the session lookup, since it needs no
 * identity; the per-uid limit as soon as there is a uid, and both before this
 * route reads anything of its own. Throttling exists to cap COST, so it has to
 * come before the work it is protecting.

/**
 * Leave the course. IRREVERSIBLE, by decision: the seat is freed, the nudges
 * stop, and coming back is a new enrolment somebody else has to make.
 *
 * Behind a TYPED CONFIRMATION of the course title, the same ritual the destroy
 * routes use and for the same reason: this is the one member-facing action on
 * the courses surface that cannot be undone by the person taking it, and a
 * mis-tapped button on a phone must not be able to do it.
 *
 * OPEN-MODE RUNS ONLY. A seat that came out of admissions has a
 * `courseApplications` row behind it that would still read "accepted" after
 * the enrolment went away, which leaves the allocation board holding a
 * placeless accepted applicant and blocks allocation publish. Reconciling the
 * two is real work with no owner yet, so the route refuses rather than
 * offering a repair it cannot perform: an admissions cohort member asks staff,
 * who use the remove route.
 *
 * The way back is the reinstate route (admins and the run's track leads),
 * which flips this row to active in the group it names and re-increments both
 * counters. It is the only way back: the enrolment row is still sitting at
 * the deterministic id, so nothing here can create a second one.
