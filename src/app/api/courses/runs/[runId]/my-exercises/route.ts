/**
 * The member's OWN exercise responses for one week — what the week page hydrates
 * its answer boxes from, and how it knows which rows are still editable.
 *
 * OWN ROWS ONLY, structurally: the query pins `uid` to the caller's own uid,
 * which comes from the session and never from a parameter. There is no code
 * path here that can widen it, and nothing about anyone else's submission
 * reaches this payload — the facilitator queue is the only cohort-wide exercise
 * surface and it lives behind a group-facilitator gate.
 *
 * ── WHY A ROUTE, NOT A CLIENT QUERY ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `courseExerciseResponses` IS own-row readable in firestore.rules, so a client
 * query would work. It comes through a route anyway because `reviewerName` has
 * to be resolved from a `users` doc the member cannot read (member PII is
 * SU-committee-and-admin only), and a member seeing "reviewed by <uid>" is not
 * a feature. Resolving it here keeps the one join server-side and keeps the
 * wire shape identical to the queue's.
 *
 * WHO MAY READ: the caller, about themselves — a live enrolment (active or
 * completed, matching the run overview's read boundary) or an admin. Note the
 * asymmetry with the submit route, which requires an ACTIVE learner enrolment:
 * a completed cohort is the member's own history to re-read but not to rewrite.
 *
 * PII: display names only, never an email (see `displayNameOf`).

 * ── THE `weekNumber` INVARIANT (why this route needs no fallback) ────────────
 * `weekNumber` is stored on the response doc but is not part of
 * `CourseExerciseResponseDoc`. It never has to be re-derived here: the SUBMIT
 * ROUTE IS THE ONLY WRITER of that collection (`allow write: if false` in
 * firestore.rules) and it always stores the number derived from `weekId`, and
 * the query below FILTERS on `weekNumber == week`. So every row this route can
 * see carries exactly `week`, and the echoed value is `week` itself.
 *
 * An id-derived fallback would be dead code, not a safety net: Firestore
 * excludes docs missing a filtered field, so a field-less row could never reach
 * one. Such a row would be invisible to this route entirely — the page would
 * render an empty writable box over a stored answer — which is why the single
 * writer stamping the field is the invariant that matters, and the only place
 * it can be broken.
