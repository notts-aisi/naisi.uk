/**
 * Publish the allocation: the moment placements stop being a draft on a board
 * and become the cohort — everyone placed gets their "you've been placed"
 * email and joins the run's cohort channel.
 *
 * WHO MAY PUBLISH: admins ∪ the run's `trackLeadUids` — same gate as the
 * board and the allocate route.
 *
 * ── "EVERYONE PLACED" IS A PRECONDITION, NOT A HOPE ─────────────────────────
 * Publishing REFUSES (409, with names) while any accepted applicant lacks an
 * active, grouped enrolment. The board shows the same count in its status
 * rail, so this refusal is the backstop, not the discovery mechanism — but it
 * is a hard one: nothing is stamped and nobody is emailed on the refusal
 * path. An accepted application with no seat is a person who was promised a
 * placement email and would silently never get one.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * RE-PUBLISH IS EXPECTED, not an error: late acceptances get placed, someone
 * gets moved, publish runs again. `enrolment.allocatedEmailAt` is the
 * idempotency guard — only enrolments LACKING the stamp are emailed, and the
 * stamp is written per-recipient after their send succeeds, so a re-publish
 * emails exactly the newly placed (and newly moved — the allocate route
 * clears the stamp on a group change) and nobody twice. The run-level
 * `allocationPublishedAt` re-stamps on every publish.
 *
 * This mail is TRANSACTIONAL (the recipient is owed it), so it goes to the
 * proven `users.email` directly — the same address discipline as the P5
 * decision emails — rather than through the notification-preference fan-out
 * used for bulk mail. The cohort-channel subscribe alongside it is what the
 * later announcement emails (P9) will fan out over.
 *
 * It is also one of the two moments that PUSH: being placed is an answer the
 * member has been waiting for. The push is mirrored per recipient in a second
 * pass after the email loop, respects their
 * `notifications.push.courses` switch, names the course and the group
 * and nothing else, and cannot fail a publish.
