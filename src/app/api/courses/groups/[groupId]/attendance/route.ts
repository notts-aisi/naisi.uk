/**
 * THE ATTENDANCE REGISTER for one group: the whole grid on GET, one session's
 * marks on POST, an admin's correction to a LOCKED register on PATCH.
 *
 * `courseAttendance` is `read/write: if false` in firestore.rules, so no
 * client ever touches it. This file and its two siblings (`attendance/push`,
 * `participant-notes`) are the only paths to the data in either direction.
 * The access rule lives in `src/lib/courses/registerAccess.ts` so all four
 * verbs answer to one predicate.
 *
 * ── A COLUMN IS A SESSION, NOT A WEEK ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Columns come from `resolveSessions`, so a group that meets twice in a week
 * gets two, each with its own register document, its own held switch and its
 * own push. For every group that meets once, which is all of them today, the
 * columns and the register ids are exactly what they were.
 *
 * ── THE DRAFT / PUSHED BOUNDARY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A register is a DRAFT the facilitator saves as often as they like during the
 * session, and PUSH ATTENDANCE is the state change: the register locks, the
 * enrolment rollups are recomputed from it, and the group's next-session
 * reminder goes out. After that:
 *  · POST REFUSES. A facilitator who needs a mark changed asks an admin, and
 *    the reason is not procedural: the push is what mailed the group and moved
 *    the numbers a reviewer reads, so a quiet edit afterwards would leave the
 *    record and the mirror describing different sessions.
 *  · PATCH is that admin's door, and every mark it moves appends its own
 *    `courseAudit` row saying what changed and from what to what.
 * A learner sees their own mark only once the register is pushed, which is
 * what makes the draft a draft.
 *
 * ── MID-RUN JOINERS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `courseEnrolments.joinedWeekNumber` travels with every member and SCOPES the
 * grid: the UI renders the cells before it as inert, and the write gate
 * REFUSES them. Without that, someone who joined in week 5 reads as four weeks
 * absent, a record that is not merely unkind but false.
 *
 * ── V2-3: THE COLUMNS ARE THE GROUP'S RHYTHM ────────────────────────────────
 * Every calendar question here is asked of the GROUP's resolved calendar: its
 * own pacing when its facilitator has set one, the run's otherwise. A group
 * that inserted its own reading week is a group that did not meet that week,
 * and a register offering a column for a session nobody held invites a
 * facilitator to mark a room full of people absent from a class that never
 * happened. Column TITLES resolve group-first too, so a week the facilitator
 * has forked and renamed reads under the name their members see.
