/**
 * PUSH ATTENDANCE: the one human action that closes a session.
 *
 * A facilitator marks the room as often as they like during the session; the
 * register is a draft the whole time. Pressing push does three things at once,
 * and the order they happen in is the whole design of this file:
 *
 *   1. THE REGISTER LOCKS. `pushedAt` and `pushedByUid` are stamped, POST
 *      refuses it from then on, and only an admin's PATCH can move a mark,
 *      each one logged.
 *   2. THE MIRRORS ARE REBUILT. Every member's `courseEnrolments.attendance`
 *      is recomputed IN FULL from this group's pushed registers. Never a
 *      delta: `applicationCounts` moves as relative increments, has no recount
 *      pass anywhere, and is therefore unreconcilable once it drifts. A mirror
 *      that can be rebuilt from its source at any time cannot drift at all.
 *   3. THE NEXT SESSION'S REMINDER GOES OUT, once, to the members of THIS
 *      GROUP, carrying the next week's material and the weekly feedback link.
 *   4. THE FOLLOW-UP CARD CLOSES. If the register had gone unmarked long
 *      enough for the scheduler to raise a committee task about it, that task
 *      is archived here: the push is the one thing the card asked for. Best
 *      effort, after the commit, and free (no reads at all) on any register
 *      pushed before the grace has passed. See `archiveRegisterFollowUp`.
 *
 * ── (1) AND (2) ARE ONE TRANSACTION. (3) IS NOT, AND MUST NOT BE. ───────────
 * A `.create()` collision inside a Firestore transaction aborts the WHOLE
 * transaction. If the send marker were claimed inside, then a second press,
 * a retry, or any race that found the marker taken would roll back the LOCK
 * and the MIRRORS as well: the register would come unlocked because an email
 * had already been sent, which is precisely backwards. So the transaction
 * commits first, and the marker is claimed by a standalone `.create()` after
 * it. A send failure after that point leaves the register locked and the
 * mirrors correct, which is the outcome we want, and the admin catch-up lane
 * (POST /api/courses/runs/[runId]/nudge, with `force`) is how the mail is
 * recovered.
 *
 * ── CLAIM BEFORE SEND ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The marker is claimed BEFORE the first message goes out, never after. That
 * trades "possible partial send" for "never a duplicate blast", the same trade
 * the run-level nudge documents at length. A missed reminder is a reminder; a
 * duplicate blast is an incident.
 *
 * ── A SECOND PRESS IS A 200, NOT AN ERROR ───────────────────────────────────
 * `{ ok: true, alreadyPushed: true }`. A facilitator pressing twice because
 * the first press was slow has done nothing wrong, and nothing happens twice.
 *
 * ── `{ force: true }`: THE ADMIN'S PER-GROUP RESEND ─────────────────────────
 * The claim-before-send trade above has one bad outcome: a transport failure
 * after the claim leaves a locked register, correct mirrors, and a group that
 * was never mailed, with the marker taken so a second press does nothing. The
 * only lane that used to reach them was the run-wide catch-up, which mails
 * every OTHER group of the run a second time to fix one.
 *
 * So an ADMIN may POST `{ force: true }` against a pushed register. It skips
 * the "already pushed" early return, re-derives the same audience, and updates
 * the existing marker with `forceCount`, `lastForcedAt`, `lastForcedByUid` and
 * a `forces` entry, the shape the run-level nudge writes for its own forces.
 * A facilitator is refused 403: the marker exists to stop a group being mailed
 * the same reminder every evening, and it must not be theirs to overwrite.
 *
 * Everything the mail needs (the config, the template) is now resolved BEFORE
 * the claim, so the ONLY thing that can fail after it is the transport itself.
 *
 * ── AN EMPTY HELD REGISTER IS REFUSED ───────────────────────────────────────
 * The participant-note lane creates the register document with a merge, so
 * "the register exists" stopped meaning "somebody marked the room". A held
 * session with no marks would push and count every eligible member absent, so
 * it is refused with the same sentence a missing register gets. Both refusals
 * are read BEFORE the throttle slot is spent: eight taps on an empty column
 * must not lock a facilitator out of pushing the register they then mark.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS ROUTE DOES NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE SESSION-1 WELCOME. There is no push before a run's first session, so
 * nothing here can send one. That send is the ADMIN CATCH-UP lane's job (the
 * run-level nudge), pressed by hand before the first week. Do not add a
 * "first session" branch here: it would need its own idempotency marker for a
 * send that happens once per run, and the catch-up lane already has one.
 * docs/courses-ops.md carries the operational half of this note.
