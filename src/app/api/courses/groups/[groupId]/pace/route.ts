/**
 * RE-PACE ONE GROUP — the calendar half of v2 decision 4's copy-on-write.
 *
 * PATCHes the group doc's `paceStartDate` / `paceWeekPlan` overrides. `null`
 * clears a field back to TRACKING THE RUN — stored as a REAL null, because
 * the rules pin these fields with a `null` default and absent-vs-null must
 * compare equal (`courseGroups.ts` documents the storage contract). Every
 * consumer then reads the result through `resolveCalendar()`; nothing else
 * may interpret these two fields.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY RE-PACE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A facilitator of THIS group while it is LIVE, ∪ admins (the pinned
 * decision: "facilitator/admin"). Track leads re-pace the RUN, client-direct;
 * this route is the room's own clock. AUTHORIZATION BEFORE EXISTENCE, one
 * indistinguishable 403 — the group email route's ordering.
 *
 * ── VALIDATED LIKE A RUN'S CALENDAR, THEN STRICTER ──────────────────────────
 * `paceWeekPlan` goes through `sanitizeWeekPlan` — the SAME sanitiser the run
 * normaliser trusts — and then through the range/uniqueness checks the
 * attendance route applies (`taughtWeeksOf`), REFUSING what the sanitiser
 * would merely drop: this route is the field's ONLY writer, so a malformed
 * entry here is a caller bug to surface, not data to accommodate.
 * `paceStartDate` must pass `isValidDateKey`: a REAL civil date, not merely a
 * string that matches the shape.
 *
 * ── THE STRAND GATE: A MARKED REGISTER CANNOT VANISH FROM THE PLAN ──────────
 * Decision, stated: a pace change that would remove a taught week whose
 * attendance register already carries marks is REFUSED — for everyone,
 * admins included, the apply-template stance — with the stranded week
 * numbers and mark counts in the response. Registers are keyed by
 * (run, group, weekNumber), so a plan that drops week 5 makes
 * `…__w05`'s marks invisible AND un-editable (the attendance route refuses
 * non-taught weeks), which is what this gate prevents. Re-cut the plan to
 * keep the week, or leave it in as history.
 *
 * Only NEWLY stranded weeks refuse: a register already orphaned by earlier
 * run-plan surgery does not hold this group's pacing hostage — the gate
 * compares the OLD effective calendar with the NEW one, both through
 * `resolveCalendar`. Start-date changes alone can never strand (registers
 * key by week NUMBER), so a date-only change with a stranded past sails
 * through, as it must.
 *
 * The check runs in ONE transaction with the write — group, run, register and
 * enrolment reads all `tx.get` — so the plan the gate approved is the plan the
 * write lands on (the apply-template shape; here the racing writer is
 * staff-tier rather than a member, but the transaction costs four reads and
 * closes the window outright).
 *
 * ── RE-OPENING THE MIRROR WINDOW (the pace-REWIND repair) ───────────────────
 * `courseEnrolments.lastTaskSyncedWeek` is the task mirror's HIGH-WATER MARK,
 * and it is monotonic BY DESIGN: `sync-tasks` compares `mark >= anchor` so that
 * an admin editing the RUN's calendar backwards cannot resurrect a card a
 * member deliberately dismissed ("DISMISSAL STICKS"). That design has a hole
 * this route is the only place that can close:
 *
 *     pace a group AHEAD → members mount → the mark stamps 8 → the facilitator
 *     clears the pace → the group is back on week 3 → weeks 3-7 are BELOW every
 *     member's mark, so they never mirror again. Five weeks of cards, silently
 *     owed to nobody.
 *
 * So on any pace CHANGE — set OR clear — the marks of this group's ACTIVE
 * enrolments are reset DOWN to ONE BELOW the group's NEW anchor week wherever
 * they sit above it. Never up: a mark below the new anchor is a member who has
 * genuinely not had those weeks yet, and `sync-tasks` will deliver the anchor
 * on their next mount exactly as it always did.
 *
 * WHY ONE BELOW AND NOT THE ANCHOR ITSELF. `sync-tasks` short-circuits on
 * `mark >= weekNumber`, so a mark reset to exactly the anchor skips the anchor
 * week — the week the group has just been rewound ONTO, and in the case this
 * repair exists for, the one week most certainly never delivered: a group
 * paced ahead to week 8 had week 8 mirrored and weeks 3-7 never. Resetting to
 * the anchor handed back weeks 4..8 of an 8→3 rewind and silently dropped
 * week 3. The correction is safe in the other direction because of the
 * ALREADY_EXISTS argument two paragraphs down: re-creating a card for a week
 * that WAS delivered and kept is a proven no-op, so the cost of being one week
 * generous is nothing, while the cost of being one week mean is a card nobody
 * ever gets. Clamped at 0 (the absent-mark default), so a rewind to week 1
 * delivers week 1.
 *
 * WHY THAT DOES NOT BREAK MONOTONICITY'S PURPOSE. The mark defends against an
 * edit nobody announced; a pace change is a FACILITATOR ACT on their own room,
 * the one edit whose entire point is to move which week their group is on. The
 * mirror's own contract already says a dismissed week stays dismissed "until
 * the cohort rolls into the next one" — a rewind means the cohort is going to
 * roll through those weeks again, and the weekly card is owed again with them.
 *
 * VERIFIED interaction with the deterministic mirror ids, both halves:
 *  · a card the member KEPT — `tasks/{courseTaskId(runId, weekNumber, uid)}`
 *    still exists, so the re-mirror's `.create()` fails ALREADY_EXISTS, is
 *    counted `alreadyPresent`, and NOTHING is overwritten. A true no-op.
 *  · a card the member DISMISSED — dismissal is a DELETE (the rules let a
 *    member remove their own mirror), so that document is gone and the
 *    re-mirror recreates it when the group next reaches that week. Stated
 *    plainly rather than glossed: this is the one behaviour the reset changes,
 *    it is bounded to the weeks between the new anchor and the old mark, and it
 *    is the correct reading of a facilitator rewinding their group's schedule.
 *    Suppressing it would need a per-member record of WHICH weeks were
 *    dismissed, which the data model deliberately does not keep.
 *
 * Bounded by GROUP SIZE (`MAX_GROUP_MEMBERS`), inside the same transaction as
 * the pace write so a group can never be left re-paced with its members' marks
 * still describing the old calendar.
