/**
 * EMAIL MY GROUP — the operational lane. "We're in B52 this week", "bring the
 * reading", "no session Tuesday". One message per member, composed by
 * their facilitator, sent through the same pipeline everything else uses.
 *
 * ── ONE MESSAGE PER RECIPIENT. NOT NEGOTIABLE. ──────────────────────────────
 * The dispatch at the bottom sends ONE `sendEmail` per address and passes a
 * single string as `to`. It must never be handed an array, and no Cc/Bcc goes
 * near it. Batching a group into one envelope would disclose every member's
 * address to every other member — the single worst failure this feature can
 * ship, and the exact disclosure the PII-free roster route exists to prevent.
 * Pacing is `dispatchSends`, shared with the run route: a bounded number in
 * flight so a send doesn't burst the SMTP relay, sized so a full-size send
 * finishes well inside App Hosting's request timeout. The arithmetic lives on
 * that helper.
 *
 * ── THE MEMBER CAP REFUSES, IT DOES NOT TRUNCATE ────────────────────────────
 * A group over `MAX_MEMBERS` FAILS the request. Nothing bounds a group below
 * that number (`capacity` is `number | null`), and the run route makes the
 * argument for both of us: a partial send is the worst outcome available,
 * because it looks successful — an arbitrary hundred get the mail, the answer
 * says `sent: 100, skipped: 0`, the composer says nobody was skipped, and a
 * retry re-mails the same hundred.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY SEND ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A facilitator of THIS group while it is LIVE, ∪ admins. Identical to the P8
 * review queue, down to the ordering: ARCHIVING A GROUP UNSTAFFS IT, and
 * AUTHORIZATION RUNS BEFORE ANY EXISTENCE CHECK, so a missing group, an
 * archived group and someone else's group collapse onto ONE indistinguishable
 * 403. Being a run facilitator, a track lead, or an admissions reviewer grants
 * nothing here — those roles address the run, not the room (see the run email
 * route). Members cannot mail their own group at all: a peer lane is a
 * different feature with a different consent model.
 *
 * ── WHO RECEIVES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The ACTIVE enrolled members of this group, derived server-side from the
 * group's own enrolment rows. The caller passes no uids and no addresses, so
 * this route cannot be steered into mailing anyone outside the room, and it
 * never hands an address back — `sent`/`skipped` are counts, and even the
 * console lines log uids, never addresses.
 *
 * ── SUBSCRIPTION vs SUPPRESSION (the distinction that matters) ──────────────
 * This is OPERATIONAL mail, so it does NOT require the marketing subscription
 * or the `courses` notification category: a member who has opted out of
 * announcements still needs to know their session moved. That is also why it
 * carries no unsubscribe footer — matching every other transactional path in
 * the estate (task membership, RSVP, collaborator lifecycle), none of which
 * offers one. The opt-outable lane is the run announcement route, which does
 * carry both the footer and the RFC 8058 headers.
 *
 * SUPPRESSION IS DIFFERENT AND IS ALWAYS HONOURED. A bounced or complained
 * address is a DELIVERABILITY fact, not a preference: continuing to send to it
 * damages the domain's reputation for every other recipient, and a complaint
 * is a request we are obliged to respect whatever the mail's category. A
 * suppressed address is skipped and counted, never sent to.
 *
 * ── IT IS THE NOTICE CLASS, AND NOW IT SAYS SO ──────────────────────────────
 * Everything the two paragraphs above describe (goes out whatever the courses
 * row says, suppression absolute, no unsubscribe affordance) IS the
 * notification grid's notice class, and it was that class in effect and nowhere
 * in writing. The real send now goes through `sendNotice`, so the recipient
 * reads a line saying why it reached them whatever their settings, and the
 * receipt carries `kind: "notice"` with `surface: "course-group"` for the
 * deliverability tab. It also PUSHES: a member of the group with a device gets
 * a notification beside the email, through `sendNoticePush`, which reads no
 * preference at all. A member with no device gets the email alone.
 *
 * The TEST lane is deliberately not a notice: it reaches the sender's own
 * address, nobody's preference is bypassed, and the deliverability tab has to
 * keep telling a rehearsal apart from the send it rehearses. It stays
 * `course-test`, carries no marker, and pushes nothing.
 *
 * ── RATE LIMIT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 3 real sends per hour per (sender, group), plus the notice lane's 10 a day
 * per group, claimed together in one transaction so a refusal on either spends
 * neither. Test sends draw on a separate, looser bucket so rehearsing a message
 * never eats the budget for sending it. Every counter is a Firestore
 * transaction: see `reserveSendSlot`.
