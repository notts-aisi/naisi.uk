/**
 * FORK ONE WEEK into this group — the copy-on-write moment of v2 decision 4.
 *
 * Copies the run's canonical week into `courseGroups/{groupId}/weeks/{wNN}`
 * IF ABSENT. From then on this group's members read the fork (through
 * `groupResolve.ts`) and admin refinements to the canonical week no longer
 * reach them. Nothing ever merges back.
 *
 * ── TWO EXPLICIT STEPS, NEVER AUTO-FORK-ON-SAVE ─────────────────────────────
 * This route only COPIES. Edits go through the sibling PATCH, which REFUSES
 * while the fork is absent — so a facilitator forks knowingly, with the UI
 * spelling out what forking means, and can never split their group off the
 * canonical curriculum as a side effect of pressing Save.
 *
 * ── THE COPY IS ID-PRESERVING. THE PLATFORM INVARIANT. ──────────────────────
 * The week's doc id and every `material.id` / `exercise.id` / `checklist.id`
 * ride across verbatim through `templateWeekFields()` — the ONE function both
 * directions of the template copy already go through (the V2-2 precedent, see
 * `courseTemplates.ts`). Member progress is keyed on those ids
 * (`courseProgress/{runId}__{uid}__{itemId}`,
 * `courseExerciseResponses/{runId}__{uid}__{weekId}__{exerciseId}`), so a
 * fork that re-minted ids would orphan every check-off and answer the moment
 * a group personalised a week. Nothing in this file may generate an id.
 *
 * ── IDEMPOTENT VIA `create()` ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two facilitators pressing Fork together race on a `create()`, and the loser
 * gets ALREADY_EXISTS — reported as `ok: true, alreadyForked: true`, because
 * the state they asked for is the state that holds. No transaction needed:
 * `create()` is the atomicity (the sync-tasks precedent).
 *
 * ── WHO MAY FORK ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A facilitator of THIS group while it is LIVE, ∪ admins — the group email
 * route's gate, down to the ordering: AUTHORIZATION BEFORE EXISTENCE, so a
 * missing group, an archived group and someone else's group collapse onto ONE
 * indistinguishable 403. Run facilitators, track leads and admissions
 * reviewers get nothing here: forking is an act of running THIS room. (Track
 * leads edit forks through the PATCH — editing content is their lane;
 * splitting a group off canonical is the facilitator's or an admin's call.)
 *
 * ── PROVENANCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `forkedAt` / `forkedByUid` stamp the split; `forkedFromRunWeekAt` records
 * the canonical week's `updatedAt` AT COPY TIME (null when it carried none),
 * so "has canonical moved on since this group forked" stays answerable.
