/**
 * THE FACILITATOR REVIEW QUEUE for one group, one week: the week's exercise
 * prompts, every active member of the group, and what each of them has written.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY READ (locked product decision) ──────────────────────────────────
 * A facilitator of THIS group, while it is LIVE (`courseGroups.facilitatorUids`
 * on a group that is not archived) ∪ admins. That is the whole list.
 *  · An archived group staffs nobody but an admin — the same rule `runAccess.ts`
 *    and the page gate apply, spelled out at the gate below.
 *  · Plain members get 403 — being in a group does not mean reading the
 *    group's homework. Peer visibility is a per-exercise flag (`peerVisible`)
 *    that a future peer lane will honour; this route is not that lane.
 *  · Another group's facilitator gets 403 — the point of small groups is that
 *    they are small, and staffing one grants nothing about the others.
 *  · Admissions reviewers and track leads get 403. Admissions is a SEPARATE
 *    LANE from the cohort (locked decision): reading applications grants no
 *    sight of anyone's work, and staffing a run is not facilitating a group.
 *    Someone who needs this view gets named on the group like everyone else —
 *    which is why the run doc is not read here at all.
 *
 * ── ENUMERATION-SAFE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The caller passes no uids. The server derives the roster from the group's own
 * enrolment rows, so you only ever see the work of people already placed in a
 * group you facilitate. The `groupId` in the path is likewise non-disclosing:
 * the facilitator check runs BEFORE any "does this group exist" answer, so a
 * missing group and someone else's group are the same 403 (see the gate below).
 *
 * ── EMPTY ROWS ARE THE POINT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every active member appears, including those who have submitted nothing. A
 * queue that listed only submissions would make "nobody did exercise 2" look
 * identical to "exercise 2 doesn't exist" — the gap IS the signal a facilitator
 * is looking for.
 *
 * PII: NAMES ONLY, via `displayNameOf`, never an email. Anything that needs to
 * reach these people by email goes through the group email route, which
 * resolves addresses server-side and never hands them out. Every field added
 * below has to be checked against that line.

 * ── THE `weekNumber` INVARIANT (why this route needs no fallback) ────────────
 * `weekNumber` is stored on the response doc but is not part of

 * ROUTE IS THE ONLY WRITER of that collection (`allow write: if false` in
 * firestore.rules) and it always stores the number derived from `weekId`, and
 * the response query below FILTERS on `weekNumber == week`. So every row this
 * queue can see carries exactly `week`, which is also the number the payload's
 * week header uses.
 *
 * An id-derived fallback would be dead code, not a safety net: Firestore
 * excludes docs missing a filtered field, so a field-less row could never reach
 * one — it would simply be invisible to this query (and to the member's own
 * my-exercises page). The single writer stamping the field is the invariant
 * that matters, and the only place it can be broken.
