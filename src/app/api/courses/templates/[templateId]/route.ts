/**
 * Delete one frozen curriculum snapshot: the doc and its `weeks`
 * subcollection.
 *
 * ADMIN ONLY, refused before any read — one indistinguishable 403 for
 * everyone else, so this route cannot be used to probe which snapshots exist.
 *
 * NOT the destroy cascade. A snapshot owns nothing but its own weeks: no
 * member work references it (progress is keyed on RUN ids, never template
 * ids), no counters move, nothing else in the database points at it except a
 * run's `templateId` provenance field — which is deliberately left dangling,
 * exactly as `destroyCourseCascade` leaves template provenance orphaned. What
 * a cohort was given is a fact about that cohort; deleting the snapshot does
 * not un-teach it, and rewriting the run's record to say "no template" would
 * be the falsification. `templateLabel` is stored alongside the id for this
 * reason: the human answer survives the row.
 *
 * So the cascade is a bounded paged delete (≤ 60 week docs by construction —
 * `COURSE_FIELD_LIMITS.maxWeekPlanEntries`) rather than the resumable,
 * audited, budgeted machinery of `courseDeletion.ts`, which exists because a
 * RUN destroy takes member work with it. Nothing here does.
 *
 * ORDER: weeks first, parent doc last. While the parent exists a failed call
 * can be repeated and still find the leftovers; deleting the parent first
 * would strand a subcollection nothing names (a parent-doc delete does NOT
 * delete subcollections in Firestore).

 * `courseDeletion` drained-guard lesson, in miniature). The parent surviving
 * is what makes the retry find the leftovers.
