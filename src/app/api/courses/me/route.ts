/**
 * "Every run you touch" — the payload behind the `/learn` hub.
 *
 * WHO MAY READ: any signed-in caller, about THEMSELVES only. There is no uid
 * parameter and no way to ask about someone else: the four queries below are
 * each scoped to `actor.uid`, so the route is enumeration-safe by construction.
 *
 * Five ways a run reaches this list, merged into one row per run because one
 * person can hold several of them at once (a track lead who also facilitates a
 * group, a reviewer who is learning on the run they help admit for):
 *
 *   learner / facilitator  — a `courseEnrolments` row (facilitators get one
 *                            when they are staffed onto a group, which is why
 *                            "every run you touch" is ONE enrolment query)
 *   reviewer               — named in `courseRuns.admissionsReviewerUids`
 *   lead                   — named in `courseRuns.trackLeadUids`
 *   offered / waitlisted   — a decided `courseApplications` row with no seat
 *                            behind it yet (see THE OFFER GAP below)
 *
 * Holding a role here grants NOTHING beyond this hub row: admissions is a
 * separate lane from the cohort (see the applications route), so a reviewer's
 * card links to the queue, never to the learning space. The overview route
 * enforces that boundary independently — this payload is a list of doors, not
 * a set of keys.
 *
 * ── THE OFFER GAP (why the fourth query exists) ─────────────────────────────
 * Accepting an application deliberately does NOT enrol anyone: "an accepted
 * application is an offer, not a seat" (the decide route's header), and the
 * `courseEnrolments` row is minted only when allocation is PUBLISHED. Between
 * those two moments — which is hours at best and a fortnight in practice — a
 * member who has just been emailed "you're in" held no row in any collection
 * this route read, so `/learn` told them "You're not on a course yet", the
 * dashboard card vanished, and the public course page told them applications
 * were shut. Every surface in the authed area agreed they were on nothing.
 *
 * So the offer is now first-class, and it is a DISTINCT KIND of row rather
 * than a faked enrolment: `membership` says which, `roles` stays exactly what
 * it always was (roles come from enrolments and the run's role arrays, never
 * from an application), and the hub renders an offer as a card that does not
 * link — there is no enrolment, so `/learn/[runId]` would bounce them straight
 * back (runAccess.ts: `canLearn` needs a live enrolment). See MyRunEntry.
 *
 * PII: names never travel at all (nobody but the caller is named), and the one
 * cross-collection lookup is a group NAME. No emails, no cohort rosters. The
 * application rows are read for exactly two fields, `runId` and `status`;
 * nothing else on them (the applicant's email, their answers) goes near the
 * payload, and the query cannot see another applicant's row at all.

 *

 *      and deliberately does NOT touch the application, so a member who was
 *      accepted, placed, and then removed still owns an `accepted` row. Trust
 *      the application alone and the hub would tell someone who has just been
 *      taken off the course that they are in and their group is coming. The
 *      enrolment document is the record of what happened LAST; the application
 *      is the record of what happened FIRST.
 *

 *      apply page's own status card (it is not news, and the run is by
 *      definition still open, so that card is still reachable); `rejected` and
