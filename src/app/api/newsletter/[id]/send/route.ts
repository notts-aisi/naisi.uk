   * THE SEND CLAIM, and it is a claim rather than a check.

   * The status gate at the top of this route reads `approved` and the write at

   * and runs against App Hosting's 60s ceiling. Nothing joined those two, so
   * two approvers pressing Send at once both passed the gate and both mailed
   * the whole list, and a request killed part way through left the draft
   * `approved` with half the list already mailed, ready for a retry that
   * mailed them again. The push leg inherited both.
   *
   * So the draft is claimed the way `POST /api/events/[id]/publish` claims
   * `announcedAt`: one transaction re-reads it, requires `approved` and no
   * standing claim, and stamps `sendClaimedAt`. A second request loses that
   * race and is refused, whether it arrived a millisecond or an hour later.
   *
   * NO NEW STATUS. A `sending` state would have to be taught to
   * `firestore.rules`, the status union, the editor's badge and every list that
   * groups by status, for a window that lasts one request. A timestamp field is
   * invisible to all of them.
   *
   * A CLAIM THAT OUTLIVES ITS REQUEST IS DELIBERATELY STICKY. An interrupted
   * send leaves the field set and every retry refused, because the alternative
   * (expiring it after N minutes) is a rule that re-mails the list on the day a
   * send is slower than N. Clearing `sendClaimedAt` on the draft document is an
   * admin's decision, made once somebody has read the send log and knows who
   * already has the mail.
