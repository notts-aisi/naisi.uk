/*
 * GIS redirect-mode landing. On phones and installed apps the Google button
 * runs ux_mode: "redirect" (popup mode stays for desktop; see
 * GoogleSignInButton.tsx), and Google form-POSTs the result HERE instead of
 * handing it to client JavaScript:
 *
 *     credential=<google id token>&g_csrf_token=<random>
 *
 * with the same g_csrf_token in a cookie. This route verifies and then hands
 * the credential straight back to the client through a short-lived cookie,
 * redirecting to /login where AuthEntry consumes it and runs the EXACT same
 * exchangeGoogleCredential path popup mode uses. Deliberately no custom-token
 * mint and no server-side session creation here: keeping one downstream code
 * path means redirect mode cannot rot separately from popup mode.
 *
 * Checks, in order:
 *
 *   1. CSRF double-submit: body g_csrf_token must equal the cookie. Blocks
 *      login CSRF (an attacker POSTing THEIR credential so the victim ends up
 *      in the attacker's account). If the COOKIE is missing entirely we
 *      reject with a distinct marker: on an installed iOS app the Google leg
 *      runs in an in-app browser whose cookie jar may be separate from the
 *      app window's, and whether the cookie survives that handback is the
 *      open device question. The distinct marker makes the answer readable
 *      from the login page's error state on a real device.
 *   2. Full token verification (signature against Google's JWKS, aud, iss,
 *      expiry) via google-auth-library, which firebase-admin already depends
 *      on; it is declared in package.json now rather than borrowed. Firebase
 *      would reject a bad token later anyway, but verifying before setting
 *      any cookie means a forged POST cannot even place a value.
 *
 * The handoff cookie is deliberately NOT httpOnly: client JS must read it to
 * call signInWithCredential. Scoped to /login, 60 second lifetime, consumed
 * and deleted on first read.
 *
 * The redirect Location must be built from NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, never from
 * request.url: on App Hosting the incoming Host header is the internal Cloud
 * Run revision URL, and a Location built from it would bounce the user off
 * the public origin. Local dev has no NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL mismatch, so
 * request.url is the fallback.
