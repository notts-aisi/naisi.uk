/**
 * Backs the re-consent gate. The signed-in user either ACCEPTS the updated
 * policies (we re-stamp their accepted version + timestamp on their own doc) or
 * DECLINES.
 *
 *  - accept → stamp { policyVersion: CURRENT_POLICY_VERSION, policyAgreedAt }.
 *  - delete → tear the account down via the shared cascade, but ONLY for
 *             collaborators and unfinished accounts. A FINISHED member is
 *             refused (409): declining members are signed out and asked to
 *             contact an admin instead (handled client-side). Mirrors
 *             /api/account/delete's scope guard.
 *
 * Always acts on the caller's OWN uid (from the session cookie) — no id is taken
 * from the client, so there's no IDOR surface.
 *
 * NEVER INSIDE A VIEW-AS SESSION (the `assertNotImpersonating()` at the top).
 * The reason is the ACCEPT stamp, not the decline branch: accepting is the one
 * write on this site whose entire value is that the person themselves made it,
 * and a view-as session records it on the member's own document as the member.
 * (The decline branch needs no protection from this guard: impersonation
 * targets always have a users doc, so `isMember` is true and the delete is
 * refused with a 409 below regardless.) The gate in
 * (app)/layout.tsx skips the redirect during view-as for the same reason, but
 * an admin can still reach /re-consent by typing it, so the refusal belongs
 * here as well as there.
