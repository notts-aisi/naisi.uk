/**
 * The conduct flag on one member: the only writer of `memberConductFlags/{uid}`.
 *
 * ## Why a route at all
 *
 * The collection is `allow read, write: if false`, admins included, so there is
 * no client path to it and this file is the whole surface. That is deliberate:
 * the row carries a free-text allegation about a named student, and the person
 * it describes must never be able to read it from a browser. The flag is not a
 * field on `users/{uid}` because that document is own-row readable and
 * `AuthProvider` holds a live `onSnapshot` on it, so a reason written there
 * would stream into the flagged member's own browser on every authed page and
 * could expose whoever reported them.
 *
 * ## Clearing deletes the row
 *
 * Unflagging deletes the document rather than writing `flagged: false`.
 * `conductChip(null)` already returns `{ flagged: false }`, so ABSENCE is the
 * cleared state everywhere that reads this collection, and a cleared-but-kept
 * row would retain the allegation text with nothing left pointing at it. The
 * account-deletion sweep is an addressed delete at the same id, so a cleared
 * flag and a deleted account leave exactly the same nothing behind.
 *
 * ## What each caller gets back
 *
 * Both handlers answer with `conductFlagForQueue(flag, true)` and nothing
 * beside it, because only an admin reaches either handler. The projection is
 * the whole body: a handler that spread it and added a sibling key would have
 * moved the "what may this viewer see" decision out of the one function that
 * makes it, and the next payload to copy the shape may be a reviewer's.
 * Reviewers never call this route: they receive
 * `conductFlagForQueue(flag, false)`, a boolean and nothing else, inside the
 * queue payload their own route builds.
 *
 * ## What is retained, and what is not
 *
 * The row itself carries who set the flag and when. Re-wording a reason
 * overwrites the old wording, and clearing a flag deletes the row outright.
 * Setting a flag on an already-flagged member therefore UPDATES THE REASON
 * ONLY and keeps the original `at`, `byUid` and `byName`, so correcting a typo
 * does not re-date somebody's record or reassign it to whoever happened to fix
 * the wording.

/**
 * Control characters out, surrounding whitespace trimmed, capped at the shared
 * limit. The reason is plain text and is rendered as a text node, never as
 * markup.
 *
 * NEWLINES SURVIVE. `MemberText` renders with `pre-wrap`, so an admin who
 * typed "what happened" on one line and "when" on the next gets back what they
 * typed. Carriage returns are folded into newlines first so a Windows browser
 * does not leave a stray control character behind, every other control
 * character becomes a space, and a run of three or more blank-ish newlines
 * collapses to one blank line so a paste cannot stretch the Members row.
