/**
 * POST /api/admin/scheduler/run: the two manual overrides.
 *
 *   { jobId }    run one registered job right now
 *   { markerId } put one failed marker back in play, for the next tick
 *
 * WHY THESE EXIST. The tick is called by an external scheduler, so an admin
 * needs a way to run one job, or put one failed marker back in play, by hand.
 * Every job on the registry is expected to ship with this button working.
 *
 * A "Run now" ignores the job's own enable switch (the admin is looking
 * straight at that switch when they click) but NOT the global one: a
 * scheduler switched off site-wide is usually off because something is
 * actively going wrong.
 *
 * No receipt is written. Receipt ids are `tick__{bucket}__d{depth}` and mean
 * "the external scheduler called"; minting a synthetic one to describe a
 * human click would make the panel's "is it running" line lie. The run's
 * outcome lands on the job's `config/scheduler` state, which is what the
 * panel shows per job.
