/**
 * Two-pass admin backfill / migration. Idempotent.
 *
 * Pass A: write a row per (verified email, channel) for EVERY user, over the
 * SUBSCRIPTION_CATEGORIES channels only (`courses` has no top-level row — see
 * the loop). The verified-email set comes from `getVerifiedEmails(userDoc)`: the Google
 * account email is always counted; the university email is only counted
 * when `profile.uniEmailVerifiedAt` is set. Members get one row per
 * (email × channel) pair with:
 *  - confirmed: true (members are inherently confirmed by their session)
 *  - subscribed: legacy_value (true iff the user-doc has the category on
 *    AND the channel-routing flag for that specific email is on)
 *  - audience: "user", audienceId: uid
 *  - source: "backfill" (or kept on existing rows)
 *
 * Audit timestamps (createdAt, confirmedAt, subscribedAt,
 * unsubscribedAt) are write-once: an existing row keeps whatever it
 * already has, and a field is only stamped the first time it applies.
 * subscribedAt and unsubscribedAt both persist once set, so a row keeps
 * its full history rather than losing the opposite timestamp on a flip.
 * This is what makes a re-run genuinely free: nothing drifts.
 *
 * Channel-routing: the legacy `notifications.channels.{gmail, uniEmail}`
 * flags decide which addresses got which categories pre-migration. The
 * backfill carries that intent forward into per-(email, channel) rows so
 * existing users don't see their settings flipped on first run. The flags
 * themselves stay on the user doc as legacy fields for now; a follow-up
 * cleanup PR drops them once the new code paths have settled.
 *
 * Currently-unsubscribed members appear in the Subscriptions admin tab
 * as subscribed=false rather than being absent.
 *
 * Pass B: migrate any pre-existing rows that still use the legacy
 * `status` enum into the new (confirmed, subscribed) shape, and nuke
 * stale `status` fields on already-migrated rows in the same pass.
 *
 * Admin-only. POST with no body. Returns counts for the operator.
