/**
 * Sends a course email template to the admin's own Google + university
 * addresses so they can proof it in a real inbox.
 *
 * Mirrors `/api/admin/application-emails/[templateId]/send-test` with one
 * behavioural difference that matters: template resolution is FALLBACK-FIRST,
 * exactly as `sendCourseApplicationEmail` does it. `courseEmailTemplates` has
 * no seed step, so "no doc" is a normal state and the defaults are what a real
 * send would use — a test that 404'd there would be testing the wrong thing.
 *
 * Six of the twelve templates render through the same `ApplicationEmail`
 * component the real course sends use, so what lands here is what an applicant
 * gets. SIX HAVE THEIR OWN COMPONENT AND ARE RENDERED THROUGH IT, for the
 * same reason in each case: that is the one implementation the recipient
 * receives, footer and degradation rules included, and a rehearsal that
 * rendered it any other way would be proofing an email nobody gets. The weekly
 * nudge goes through `renderCourseNudge` into `CourseNudgeEmail`; the five
 * admissions templates go through `admissionsPreview` below, which is
 * exhaustive over `AdmissionsTemplateId` so a sixth one cannot be added
 * without a branch. The count above is checked by nothing, so keep it honest
 * when a template is added.

 * Sample paragraphs for the appointment round's two decisions, so a rehearsal
