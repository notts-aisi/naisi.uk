/**
 * Grant or revoke one person's membership for one period.
 *
 * ## The row and the cache move together, or not at all
 *
 * A grant writes TWO things: the `memberships/{uid}__{periodId}` row, which is
 * the record (tier, source, how they were matched, who granted it), and the
 * `users.paidMembershipYears` entry, which is the queryable CACHE every
 * existing badge already reads. They are written in ONE transaction, because
 * a half-applied grant is the worst of both: a record nobody can see, or a
 * badge with nothing behind it. This route is the only writer of that cache;
 * `adminMutations.setPaidMembership` is gone, and a repo guard test keeps it
 * that way.
 *
 * ## The cap is checked BEFORE the write, and refuses by name
 *
 * `normalizeUser` keeps `FIELD_LIMITS.maxPaidMembershipYears` entries. Writing
 * an eleventh anyway would push one off the end and a member would simply stop
 * having a badge, with nothing anywhere saying why, so the transaction
 * pre-checks the count and refuses with `MembershipYearCapError` rather than
 * truncating. (`normalizeUser` also sorts newest-first before its slice now,
 * so even a document that grew past the cap by hand keeps the CURRENT year.)
 *
 * ## alumni is a row with no cache entry
 *
 * `TIER_COUNTS_AS_MEMBER` is applied here, at write time. An alumni grant
 * records a true fact about a person and deliberately does NOT enter the
 * cache, because they are not a member of the society this year. Re-granting
 * an existing paid row as alumni therefore REMOVES the cache entry in the same
 * transaction, which is why the cache is rewritten from the row's tier rather
 * than merely added to.
 *
 * ## Revoke deletes
 *
 * A revoke removes the row and the cache entry together. The alternative, a
 * `revokedAt` stamp, would leave a row that reads as a membership to anything
 * that forgot to check the field, and a mis-recorded membership is not history
 * worth keeping.
 *
 * This route ADMINISTERS membership and lives under /api/admin, so nothing
 * here may be gated on the maintenance notice (tests/no-admin-gating.test.mjs).
