/**
 * Admin tool: wipes every task in this Firestore project, plus all
 * subcollections (comments / activity / attachments) and the corresponding
 * Storage blobs. Lives under `/api/admin/...` (not `/api/tasks/...`)
 * because it isn't a per-task op and shouldn't share permission gates
 * with the in-app delete.
 *
 * Targets whichever Firestore project the App Hosting backend is wired
 * to: the Admin SDK reads project credentials from the runtime env, so a
 * backend only ever wipes its own project.
 *
 * Belt-and-braces gate: admin role + `confirm: "DELETE ALL TASKS"`
 * literal string in the request body. The literal-string requirement
 * exists so a curl reflex or copy-paste accident can't fire the route
 * accidentally; the client UI types it for the user after a strong
 * confirm modal.
