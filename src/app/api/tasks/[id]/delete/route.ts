/**
 * Cascade-delete a task: every comment, every activity entry, every
 * attachment (Firestore doc + Storage object), plus the parent task doc.
 *
 * Client-side rules block subcollection delete for non-admins (activity is
 * `allow update, delete: if false`; comments are admin-only). Doing this
 * server-side via Admin SDK is the only correct path — it bypasses rules
 * but we mirror the task-level delete authorization here:
 *   - admin (any task)
 *   - committee who created a committee-visibility task
 *   - creator of a personal task
 *   - COMPLETER of a `fellowship-reminder` task (the course-week mirror's
 *     dismissal). This branch is what makes the rules' matching branch
 *     reachable at all: nothing in the app deletes a task through the client
 *     SDK, so `deleteTask()` → this route is the only path a member has, and
 *     without it the Delete button on a mirror rendered and then 403'd.
 *     Keyed on `isCompleter` rather than `isCreator` so it matches the rules
 *     predicate byte for byte and survives however the mirror was
 *     materialised (the sync route makes the member both; an admin-triggered
 *     backfill might not).
 *
 * Every branch reads `source` / `visibility` / the rosters off the EXISTING
 * document — never off the request — so a caller cannot talk its way into a
 * delete by claiming a source it does not have.
 *
 * Storage objects for attachments are enumerated BEFORE the recursive doc
 * delete so we still have their `storagePath` values. Storage failures
 * (object missing, ACL blip) are logged but don't block the Firestore
 * cleanup — an orphaned Storage blob is strictly better than a phantom
 * Firestore doc (blob is invisible to the Console, phantom doc keeps
 * cluttering the tasks list).
