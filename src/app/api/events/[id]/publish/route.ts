/**
 * Server-only transition from "approved" to "published". Firestore rules block
 * clients from writing status == "published" directly (mirrors the newsletter
 * "sent" gate). Gated to approvers + admins.
 *
 * ── AND THE ONE MOMENT THE `events` ROW SENDS ANYTHING ──────────────────────
 * Publishing is what the notification grid's events row has always promised
 * ("a short email when we publish a new event") and what nothing has ever
 * delivered. It sends here, once per event, to the events row on both columns:
 * by email to the `subscriptions` junction the way the newsletter sends, and by
 * push to members whose events push cell is on. `sendEventAnnouncement` owns
 * both audiences and the whole argument for them.
 *
 * ── ONCE PER EVENT, UNDER A CLAIM ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * `announcedAt` is stamped on the event document INSIDE the transaction that
 * publishes it, so two requests racing to publish the same event cannot both
 * come out holding the announcement: one wins the status transition and the
 * loser sees a status that is no longer "approved". The stamp also survives a
 * later republish (an event pulled back to approved and pushed live again is
 * not news twice), which the status check alone would not catch.
 *
 * The claim is made BEFORE the send rather than after it, and that is a real
 * trade: an announcement that fails after the stamp is not retried, and the
 * event is live with nobody told. The other way round is worse, because it
 * fails in the direction of mailing the whole list twice. The failure is logged
 * and counted in the response so a publisher can see it happened.
 *
 * ── TWO PATHS OUT OF THAT CLAIM, AND A SWITCH DECIDES WHICH ────────────────
 * The send itself runs inside this request, against `apphosting.yaml`'s
 * `timeoutSeconds: 60`, which is why it carries three ceilings. The way past
 * them is the `event-announcements` scheduler job (docs/notifications.md), and
 * this route is where the two paths part.
 *
 * The job's switch is read ONCE, before the transaction. A switch flipped
 * during a request is not a case worth a read inside it: the announcement is
 * claimed either way, and whichever path this request chose is the path that
 * delivers it.
 *
 *  - SWITCH OFF (the shipped default): everything below runs exactly as it
 *    always has. Nothing changes for anybody until an admin flips it.
 *  - SWITCH ON: the same transaction that stamps `announcedAt` also writes
 *    `announcementState: "queued"` and `announcementQueuedAt`, and this route
 *    sends nothing at all. The job picks the event up on the next tick, one
 *    marker per recipient, and writes the result back onto the document for
 *    the editor to read. On a backend with no scheduler secret the tick does
 *    not run.
 *
 * ── AND A PURE REFUSAL HANDS THE CLAIM BACK ─────────────────────────────────
 * There is one outcome where the trade above buys nothing: the announcement
 * REFUSES, deterministically, before it dispatches anything (the list is over
 * its ceiling). Nothing was sent, nothing can have been half-sent, and yet the
 * claim is spent, `announce` can never be true again, and no supported action
 * gets the announcement out. So that one case clears `announcedAt` and says so
 * in the response: the ceiling can be raised and the event republished. The
 * job applies the same rule to its own refusals.
 *
 * The condition is deliberately narrow: a refusal AND nothing sent, failed or
 * pushed. A THROW is not released: `dispatchSends` can reject after other
 * workers have already delivered, so a retry there would re-mail people. A
 * partial send keeps its claim for the same reason.
 *
 * ── PUBLISHING NEVER FAILS BECAUSE THE ANNOUNCEMENT FAILED ──────────────────
 * The write is committed first and the send is best effort inside a try/catch,
 * exactly as the stage-release job treats its push. An event that went live
 * without its email is a missing email; an announcement that turned a publish
 * into a 500 would be an event that IS live on a page saying it failed to save.
