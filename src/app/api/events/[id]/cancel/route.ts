/**
 * Cancel a whole event. Sets status to "cancelled" and, when the organiser
 * ticked the notify box, tells every confirmed and waitlisted attendee through
 * the NOTICE LANE: an `EventCancelledEmail` framed as a cancellation rather
 * than a generic update, plus a notification to every attendee with an account.
 *
 * Routed through the Admin SDK because Firestore rules block client writes to
 * published events, and cancelling also needs to read attendee PII to send.
 * Gated to approvers + admins, matching the publish and update routes.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ATTENDEE NOTICE IS A NOTICE ─────────────────────────────────────
 * "The event you are coming to tonight is off" is the clearest case the class
 * has: the recipient asked for the event, the message is about that event, and
 * a notification grid switch must not be the reason somebody turns up to an
 * empty room. So it goes by email AND by push whatever their rows say, it
 * carries the marker line explaining why, and its receipt carries `kind:
 * "notice"` with `surface: "event-cancel"`. Suppression still applies: a
 * bounced address is a fact about an inbox, not a preference.
 *
 * ── THE CAP IS CLAIMED BEFORE THE CANCELLATION, NOT AFTER ───────────────────
 * The notice lane's caps bound how often one audience can be reached, and this
 * lane shares the event broadcast's per-audience daily counter, so an organiser
 * who has already sent today's ten notices can meet a refusal here. That
 * refusal has to arrive BEFORE the status write, or the answer would be "the
 * event is cancelled and nobody was told", which is the one outcome worse than
 * either half. So the slot is claimed first and a refused request changes
 * nothing at all: the organiser can retry, or untick "notify attendees" and
 * cancel without a message. The refusal sentence names the cap.
 *
 * ── AND IT CLAIMS THE DAILY WINDOW ONLY ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The room notice's exemption, for the room notice's reason. The hourly window
 * is per (sender, event) and is SHARED with the broadcast lane, so an organiser
 * who sent three change notices during a chaotic afternoon would be refused the
 * one message nobody can be left without, and the most time-critical send in
 * the lane would be rationed by the most routine one. A cancellation happens
 * once per event (the already-cancelled check above is what enforces that, not
 * a throttle), so the per-audience daily cap is the bound that still means
 * something here, and it is kept.

 * WHICH RSVP STATUSES HEAR ABOUT A CANCELLATION. Confirmed attendees hold a
