/**
 * ORGANISER BROADCAST, and the events half of the NOTICE LANE.
 *
 * A one-off update to everyone holding a place at an event: the room moved, the
 * speaker is late, bring a laptop. It also carries the post-publish change
 * notice `EventEditor` sends after an edit to a published event, over the diff
 * `update/route.ts` returns, which is the same message with the diff attached.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS A NOTICE, AND WHAT THAT COSTS ─────────────────────────────────
 * The notification grid gives every member four rows and two columns, and this
 * send reads none of them. A person who signed up for an event has asked to be
 * told about that event, and an organiser who cannot reach their own attendees
 * has no way to run the evening. So this goes out by email AND by push whatever
 * the recipient's switches say, and the price of that exception is paid in
 * three places: the email carries a visible marker line saying why it reached
 * them (`sendNotice` builds it), the receipt carries `kind: "notice"` and
 * `surface: "event-broadcast"` so the deliverability tab can show what
 * bypassed, and the caps below bound how often it can happen. Suppression is
 * NOT bypassed: a bounce or a complaint is a fact about an address, not a
 * preference, and no class of message outranks it.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY SEND ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Admins, the event's AUTHOR, anyone in its `collaboratorUids`, or SU-recognised
 * committee. An author and their named collaborators are the people
 * responsible for the event, which is exactly the notice class's predicate, as
 * long as they still hold an approved account, which is what the standing
 * check below insists on.
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION BEFORE EXISTENCE, in the courses routes' ordering: the event is
 * read first because the gate depends on it, and a caller who is none of the
 * four gets one indistinguishable 403 whether or not the id exists.
 *
 * ── THE AUDIENCE IS DERIVED HERE AND NEVER HANDED BACK ──────────────────────
 * RSVP addresses are PII that `firestore.rules` restricts to SU-recognised
 * committee and admins, and this gate now admits people who are neither. So the
 * caller supplies no addresses and no uids, the audience comes off the event's
 * own RSVP rows server side, and the response is COUNTS ONLY. The console lines
 * carry the RSVP row id, never the address, for the same reason.
 *
 * ── ONE MESSAGE PER RECIPIENT ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One `sendNotice` per address, a single string as `to`, no Cc and no Bcc.
 * Batching an event's attendees into one envelope would disclose every
 * attendee's address to every other attendee.
 *
 * ── THE LOCATION IS PER RECIPIENT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A confirmed attendee holds a place and gets the exact location; a waitlisted
 * one does not and gets the public label, and the "Where" line of a change
 * notice is redacted for them the same way. Both come from
 * `@/lib/events/location`, the one module that decides this.
 */

/**
 * WHICH RSVP STATUSES COUNT AS ATTENDING.
 *
 * `confirmed` holds a place. `waitlisted` is one cancellation away from holding
 * one, so a room change reaches them by default and the composer's tick is what
 * drops them. The other three are deliberately out: `pending` has asked and not
 * yet been approved, so they are not attending anything yet and an "our room
 * moved" would be the first they heard of a place they may not get; `denied`
 * and `cancelled` are not coming. The same list decides who is pushed.
