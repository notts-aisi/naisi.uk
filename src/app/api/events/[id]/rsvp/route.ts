/**
 * PUBLIC RSVP SUBMISSION, and the only route a signed-out person can write an
 * `eventRsvps` row through.
 *
 * ── IDENTITY, AND WHO IT IS CHECKED AGAINST ─────────────────────────────────
 * A signed-in caller is the session: name and address come off it, whatever
 * the body says, and their RSVP is unique per ACCOUNT on the event. A
 * signed-out caller is an address they typed, unverified, and their RSVP is
 * unique per ADDRESS on the event. Those are two different keys on purpose. A
 * row filed by a stranger who typed a member's address must never occupy the
 * member's place: the member's own submission is matched by uid, so the
 * stranger's row sits beside it as one more pending request for the organiser
 * to see through, which is what it is.
 *
 * Document ids are Firestore's own and carry nothing derived from the address,
 * and the address lookup below is a query inside the transaction.
 *
 * ── A SIGNED-OUT CALLER LEARNS NOTHING ──────────────────────────────────────
 * A signed-out submission answers `{ ok: true, status: "pending" }` whether a
 * row was created or one already existed. The truth goes to the INBOX, which
 * only the address owner reads: a duplicate earns a note saying an RSVP is
 * already on file, and what state it is in, once an hour at most. A signed-in
 * caller asking about their own account still gets the 409, because that is
 * their own row. `tests/event-rsvp-identity.test.mjs` executes both.
 *
 * ── AN APPROVED ACCOUNT FOR A MEMBERS-ONLY EVENT ────────────────────────────
 * `getCurrentUser` hands back a session for every role, `pending` and
 * `rejected` included, so "signed in" was never "a member". A members-only
 * event admits `member`, `committee` and `admin`, the same three the
 * broadcast route treats as approved.
 *
 * ── AFTER A CANCELLATION OR A DENIAL ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A person may submit again, and that is a NEW row: the old one keeps its
 * status, the organiser's note and who decided it, rather than being reset
 * underneath them by whoever next typed the address.
 *
 * ── THE BOT GATE, AND WHY THIS ROUTE NEEDS ONE ──────────────────────────────
 * Every accepted submission writes a row and posts a NAISI-branded email, from
 * the society's own sending domain, to an address the CALLER chose, carrying a
 * greeting name and free-text answers the caller also chose.
 *
 * So the same two gates `/api/register` carries, in the same order and for the
 * same reasons. The per-IP throttle runs FIRST, before the session lookup and
 * before any document is read, because the point of throttling is to cap cost
 * and a limiter behind the reads it protects has already paid for the request
 * it is about to refuse. reCAPTCHA is the primary gate and the throttle is the
 * cheap backstop; the per-IP allowance is deliberately looser than the
 * register route's, because a stall at a fair or a shout-out in a lecture
 * produces a real burst of sign-ups from one campus NAT address, while
 * `/api/register` is a thing people do once.
 *
 * `verifyRecaptcha` FAILS CLOSED in production when `RECAPTCHA_SECRET` is
 * absent, which is why that secret has to be on every backend running in
 * production mode. `scripts/e2e/tests/public-write-gating.test.mjs` is the
 * battery that asks a deployed backend whether the gate is really live here.
