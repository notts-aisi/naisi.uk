/**
 * Set the signed-in user's REAL password and record it on their registration
 * row, SERVER-SIDE and in one request. The verify-first register flow creates
 * the account with a server-random throwaway password; this is where the user
 * replaces it (after proving inbox ownership via the magic link).
 *
 * Doing the password set on the server (Admin SDK updateUser) rather than a
 * client `updatePassword` + a separate best-effort flip is what makes the tracker
 * reliable: the credential and the `passwordSet` flag are written in the SAME
 * request, so the flag can't be lost to navigation, a dropped fetch, or a closed
 * tab (the bug that left accounts with a password at "verified-no-password").
 *
 * A password is NOT a finished registration. The row moves to "pending-profile"
 * here and to "completed" only when a profile exists; the profile form is the
 * next screen, and the sign-in between the two is the step that once failed
 * for everybody. Authenticated as the user themselves; only ever acts on the
 * caller's own uid (no oracle, can't touch anyone else).
