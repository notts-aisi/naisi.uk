/**
 * SENDING A WORKSHEET: the route that turns a library document into a
 * circulation, a response document and a task per recipient, and a message.
 *
 * ── WHY NONE OF THIS CAN BE A CLIENT WRITE ──────────────────────────────────
 * `firestore.rules` closes `create` on `circulations`, on `responses` and on a
 * worksheet task's whole shape, and this route is the reason. Creating a
 * circulation names OTHER PEOPLE as staff (which grants them every recipient's
 * answers), mints tasks in the sender's name on other people's boards, and
 * sends mail. A rule can check a shape; it cannot check that the person named
 * as a reviewer agreed to be one, cannot write a hundred documents atomically,
 * and cannot send an email. So the permission (`circulateWorksheet`) is checked
 * here, `staffUids` is composed here, and the client writes none of it.
 *
 * ── THE COPY IS THE POINT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `items` is COPIED onto the circulation. Editing the library worksheet
 * afterwards changes nothing that has been sent, which is what makes a sent
 * worksheet answerable at all: answers are keyed by question id against this
 * frozen array, and a live pointer at the library document would rewrite the
 * questions under people who had already answered them.
 *
 * ── ORDER OF WRITES, AND WHAT SURVIVES A FAILURE ────────────────────────────
 * The circulation first, then the recipients, then the library's
 * `lastCirculatedAt`, then the mail. Each step is recoverable from the state
 * the one before it left:
 *   · circulation created, mint failed  → an empty circulation the sender can
 *     add people to from its own page, and a 500 that says so and names it;
 *   · mint done, stamp failed           → a cosmetic "last sent" date on the
 *     library card is wrong. Logged and swallowed; failing a send that has
 *     already happened over a decoration would be the worse answer;
 *   · everything done, mail failed      → counted inside the notifier, which
 *     never throws. The work exists and the tasks are on the boards.

 * (a typo) by ignoring it and defaulting the real event to ON, which is the
 * one direction this must not fail in: the sender believes they turned a
 * message off. So unknown keys are a 400 and the normaliser only fills in the
 * events the body did not mention.
 *
 * `dueSoon` carries a third key, `slots`, which is its reminder SCHEDULE
 * (`src/lib/reminders/slots.ts`). It is checked the same strict way rather
 * than sanitised silently: `sanitizeSlots` repairs a list on the way out of
 * Firestore, which is right for a stored document and wrong for a request,
 * because a sender who asked for 09:00 and had it quietly dropped would be
