/**
 * COUNTS FOR ONE QUESTION.
 *
 * ── THIS IS THE ONLY PATH BY WHICH A RECIPIENT LEARNS ANYTHING ABOUT ────────
 * ── ANOTHER RECIPIENT, AND IT HANDS OVER COUNTS WITH NO NAMES ──────────────
 * Everywhere else in the feature a recipient is sealed off from the others by
 * construction: `circulations/{id}/responses/{uid}` admits the owner BY
 * DOCUMENT ID, which is not a thing a query can constrain, so a recipient's
 * list of the subcollection is refused outright while their get of their own
 * response is allowed. That shape is what makes "one recipient can never
 * enumerate what the others wrote" a property of the rules rather than a
 * promise made by a page.
 *
 * A poll breaks that seal ON PURPOSE and only this far. The body of this
 * response is a question id, a total and a map from option id to a NUMBER.
 * There is no uid in it, no name, no timestamp and no per-person anything, and
 * that is by construction rather than by filtering: the handler never builds a
 * per-person structure it then has to remember to strip.
 *
 * The gate below therefore has two halves that must both hold for a recipient:
 * the question is a POLL (the one type whose author opted into an audience for
 * its aggregate), and the poll's `resultsVisibility` admits them at their
 * current state. Every other question type, and a poll set to `staff`, answer
 * 403 to a recipient however they spell the request. Staff pass both halves by
 * being staff: this is their own circulation's data.
 *
 * ── "BEFORE-SUBMIT" MEANS VOTE FIRST, THEN SEE ──────────────────────────────
 * The setting is named for the SUBMISSION it does not wait for, not for the
 * answer it does. A recipient reading the tally before they have picked
 * anything is reading a primed vote into existence: the thing they came to
 * give an opinion on has already told them what the room thinks. So this arm
 * asks for a stored, non-empty answer to THIS question, and the respond page's
 * poll panel keeps the same rule on screen ("Results appear once you answer"),
 * which is the sentence wave 1 put in front of members. A frozen response
 * passes without one: once somebody has submitted there is nothing left to
 * prime, and refusing a person who skipped an optional poll would be a
 * permanent refusal for no gain.
 *
 * ── A GET, BECAUSE IT WRITES NOTHING ────────────────────────────────────────
 * No audit row, no counter, no stamp. The export beside it is a POST for
 * exactly the opposite reason (it logs, and a GET is prefetched and retried),
 * and the difference between the two is worth keeping visible. Nothing here
 * calls `assertNotImpersonating()` and nothing should: reading what a member
 * sees is what view-as exists for, and `tests/impersonation-guard.test.mjs`
 * only requires the guard on mutating handlers.
 *
 * ── IN-PROGRESS ANSWERS COUNT ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A vote is a vote the moment it is stored, not when the worksheet around it
 * is submitted. Counting only submitted responses would make a live poll read
 * as empty for as long as anybody was still working, which is precisely the
 * window a "before-submit" poll exists to be read in. The staff view says so
 * on screen ("includes in-progress answers"); the recipient's bars say the
 * same thing by being live.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS COSTS, AND WHAT WOULD FIX IT ──────────────────────────────────
 * Counting one question reads every response document on the circulation, so a
 * hundred recipients with three live polls is three hundred document reads per
 * person who opens the page. That is affordable at committee scale (a
 * circulation is tens of people, and the panel fetches once per stored answer
 * rather than on a timer) and it is the honest place to say it will not scale
 * to a cohort. A projection would not help: `select()` cuts the bytes on the
 * wire, not the number of documents billed. The fix, when a circulation is
 * ever large enough to need one, is a counter per option maintained by the
 * write path, and it is deliberately not built here: a counter that drifts
 * from the answers is a poll that lies, and nothing in v1 justifies that risk.
 */

/**
 * The wire shape. Deliberately narrow: see the module comment.
 *
 * Two things in here are wider than today's only caller needs, and both are
 * deliberate rather than left over. `type` is what tells a client WHICH arm it
 * was handed without re-deriving it from a question it may not hold (the poll
 * panel does hold the question and ignores the field; a staff tool asking for
 * a question id it was given would not). The `distribution` and `mean` arm has
 * no caller at all yet, because the staff aggregate view counts the response
 * documents it already holds rather than asking this route: it exists so a
 * rating asked of somebody who cannot list the subcollection has an answer,
 * and so the route's shape does not have to change the day one does.
