/**
 * Every response to one circulation, as a CSV.
 *
 * ## A POST, and the log is written FIRST
 *
 * Both halves are lifted deliberately from `admin/membership/export`, which
 * carries the long version of the reasoning; the short version, because it
 * applies here at least as hard:
 *
 *  - NO WRITE ON A GET. A browser prefetches a GET, a proxy retries one, and a
 *    link pasted into a chat is fetched by whatever unfurls it. An export
 *    writes an audit row, so it cannot be a GET;
 *  - the `dataExports` row is written BEFORE the file is handed over, and a
 *    failure to write it REFUSES the export. `logExport` throws rather than
 *    swallowing exactly so that is not optional.
 *
 * What leaves the platform here is stronger than a membership list: it is what
 * each named person actually WROTE, in their own words, on a worksheet they
 * were told was being reviewed by the people running it. The export therefore
 * leaves a durable record of who took it, which circulation it covered and how
 * many people were in it.
 *
 * To be exact about the order: the responses and the names ARE read first,
 * because `rowCount` belongs in the record and an estimate would make the log
 * worth less than it is. Those rows sit in memory and go nowhere. What the log
 * gates is the only step that hands them over, and nothing between the log
 * write and the response can fail open.
 *
 * ## Staff, and staff of THIS circulation
 *
 * `isCirculationStaff` is the same predicate the rules use (`staffUids`, plus
 * admins), so the file contains exactly what the person could already read on
 * the circulation page one recipient at a time. It does NOT require
 * `circulateWorksheet`: a reviewer named on a circulation is there to read the
 * answers, and the spreadsheet holds the same answers.
 *
 * ## No email addresses
 *
 * Names come from the `users` documents through `displayNameOf`, which is the
 * repo-wide fallback chain and ends at "NAISI member", never at an address.
 * There is no email column, no university-email column and no option for one:
 * the owner did not ask for contact details, the file is answers rather than a
 * mailing list, and `toCsvRows` is handed names only, so there is nothing in
 * scope for one to be added from by accident.
 */
