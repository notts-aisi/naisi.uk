/**
 * DESTROY a circulation. The engine (`src/lib/worksheets/destroy.ts`) owns the
 * cascade, its ordering, the audit row and resumability; this route owns WHO
 * and WHETHER, and it mirrors `POST /api/courses/runs/[runId]/destroy` line
 * for line because a second destroy protocol with different habits would be a
 * second thing to learn before anybody could trust it:
 *
 *  - ADMIN ONLY, never the sender. It is not a matter of who owns the
 *    circulation: what dies is other people's answers. Authorisation runs
 *    BEFORE the existence check, so a non-admin learns nothing about which
 *    circulation ids exist.
 *  - TYPED CONFIRMATION: `confirmName` must equal the circulation's title
 *    EXACTLY, byte for byte, with no server-side trimming (whatever
 *    normalisation the UI applies is the UI's business; the server compares
 *    what arrives). The check runs on a resume too, because the circulation
 *    document survives until the cascade's last write, so the title is still
 *    there to hold the admin to. An UNTITLED circulation is refused outright,
 *    before the comparison: confirming "" against "" is a ritual that passes
 *    by typing nothing, which is not a confirmation at all.
 *  - BLOCKERS to 409 with the sentences intact. Nothing about the circulation
 *    itself refuses a destroy (see `circulationDestroyBlockers`); what does is
 *    a Storage folder that would not list, because the manifest cannot then say
 *    how many of somebody's uploaded answers are about to go. The engine
 *    re-checks that on every FRESH pass, so a request made without reading the
 *    manifest is refused here rather than proceeding, and a resume is never
 *    re-blocked.
 *  - ONE PASS AT A TIME to 409: a second invocation arriving while another
 *    holds the claim is refused rather than allowed to count the same pages
 *    into the same totals twice.
 *
 * RESPONSE CONTRACT: `{ ok, deleted, complete, auditId }`. `deleted` is the
 * audit row's ACCUMULATED totals for this destroy, not just this invocation's
 * page, because the client renders it as the running total and a resume may be
 * running in a tab that knows nothing about earlier passes. `complete: false`
 * means the page budget ran out and the client repeats the SAME call (same
 * `confirmName`) until `complete: true`. The circulation is unreachable
 * throughout: the engine's opening write set `destroying` and `closed` before
 * anything died, and both the respond page and the circulation page read them.
 *
 * NO EMAIL IS SENT. Nobody is told their answers have been destroyed, because
 * no destroy sends mail. An admin who needs the recipients to know tells them.
