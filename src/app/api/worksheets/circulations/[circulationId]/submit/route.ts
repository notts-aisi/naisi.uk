/**
 * "This is my answer": the one write that takes a response out of the
 * recipient's hands.
 *
 * ── WHY A ROUTE AND NOT A CLIENT WRITE ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `firestore.rules` holds the recipient's own writes to `state in ['not-opened',
 * 'started']`, so a client cannot declare itself submitted at all. It must not
 * be able to, because submitting is four things at once: the required questions
 * are checked against the circulation's frozen copy, the response is frozen,
 * the sender's counter moves, and the task crosses the board. Only the first of
 * those could be expressed as a rule, and a client that could do the other
 * three could do them without doing the first.
 *
 * ── ONE TRANSACTION, AND WHY THE READS ARE INSIDE IT ────────────────────────
 * The gate and the write are ONE decision. A close landing between a
 * non-transactional read and its write would accept a submission into a closed
 * circulation; a staff unfreeze landing there would be silently undone. The
 * reads are therefore transactional and the refusals travel out as a typed
 * error (a `Response` built inside the callback would abort nothing and be
 * swallowed as the transaction's result, the same trap the course submit route
 * documents).
 *
 * ── THE STORED PROGRESS IS COSMETIC; THIS IS THE AUTHORITY ──────────────────
 * `progress` is written by the recipient's client on every autosave and is
 * re-derived here from the answers as stored, against the items as stored. So a
 * client that lies about its progress bar cannot talk its way past a required
 * question: `validateSubmission` reads the same two arrays, and it is the
 * function the respond page calls too, which is what makes "the page let me
 * submit but the server refused" impossible rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * ── OWN RESPONSE ONLY, STRUCTURALLY ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The response is ADDRESSED at the caller's own uid. There is no uid in the
 * body, no query, and therefore no way to spell somebody else's response
 * however the request is shaped. A caller who was never sent this worksheet has
 * no document at that address and gets a 404.
