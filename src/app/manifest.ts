 * Web app manifest, served at /manifest.webmanifest.
 *
 * This is what makes the site installable to the home screen on iOS and
 * Android. It is progressive enhancement and nothing more: a browser that
 * ignores this file sees the site exactly as before, and no service worker is
 * required for either platform to install us (Chrome dropped the fetch-handler
 * requirement in 108 on mobile and 112 on desktop, and iOS 26 installs any
 * site with no requirements at all).
 *
 * Next discovers this file statically and injects <link rel="manifest"> into
 * every page, so the root layout deliberately does NOT set metadata.manifest.
 * mergeStaticMetadata runs after a layout's own metadata and would overwrite
 * an explicit value anyway.
 *
 * The route is a Route Handler, cached by default. Nothing here touches a
 * request-time API, so it prerenders. src/proxy.ts's matcher does not cover
 * /manifest.webmanifest, and browsers fetch manifests uncredentialed, so there
 * is no auth interaction to worry about.
