/**
 * /worksheets/{worksheetId}: write the questions, then send them.
 *
 * A CLIENT PAGE, so the route param comes from `useParams` rather than the
 * awaited `params` promise a server page gets in Next 16. Everything on this
 * screen moves under the reader (the document is live, the circulations list is
 * live, the editor autosaves), so there is nothing here for a server render to
 * do that the first snapshot would not immediately replace.
 *
 * ── THE LOCAL DRAFT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The document is hydrated into local state ONCE per worksheet id, and every
 * later snapshot is ignored. That is deliberate: the snapshot stream carries
 * back the writes this page just made, and re-seeding the boxes from it would
 * move the caret mid-word and undo a keystroke that had not been saved yet. The
 * cost is that a second editor's changes are not seen live. Two people editing
 * one library worksheet is already last-write-wins (only the author and admins
 * can write it at all), so what would be lost is the display of a conflict
 * rather than the conflict itself.
 *
 * ── AUTOSAVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two debounced writers, not one. The header (title and description) and the
 * items are independent patches, and `useDebouncedWrite`'s queue is one slot
 * deep with newest-wins: pushing a `{ items }` and then a `{ title }` through a
 * single writer would drop whichever lost the race. The header writer always
 * pushes BOTH of its fields from current state, so coalescing two keystrokes in
 * different boxes cannot lose one.
 *
 * `keepalive` is accepted and ignored by both writers, unlike the fetch-backed
 * ones the hook was built for: a Firestore write is handed to the SDK's own
 * queue, and there is no request object to mark. A hard navigation during the
 * debounce window can still take an unsaved keystroke, which is why the fields
 * flush on blur.
