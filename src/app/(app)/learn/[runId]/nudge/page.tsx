/**
 * Server shell for THIS WEEK'S NUDGE — the prepared reminder a cohort gets
 * about the week it is on.
 *
 * ── THE NUDGE IS SENT BY A PERSON ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no scheduler in this app (App Hosting, 60s request timeout), so
 * nothing here fires on a timer. The nudge is a PREPARED MESSAGE with a button:
 * the route composes it from the admin-edited `course-week-nudge` template, the
 * panel shows exactly what would go out and to how many people, and a
 * facilitator presses send. The send route is idempotent per (run, week) so an
 * external scheduler could later be pointed at it unchanged; that future is
 * designed for and deliberately not built. `NudgePanel`'s header carries the
 * full write-up.
 *
 * ── THE GATE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A RUN facilitator (named on `runFacilitatorUids`), a TRACK LEAD, or an admin
 * — byte-for-byte the predicate the nudge route enforces and the one the cohort
 * email shell beside it uses, for the same two reasons:
 *
 *   A GROUP FACILITATOR gets nothing here. The nudge addresses the whole
 *   cohort, and facilitating one room of a run is not the same as speaking for
 *   all of it. That facilitator mails their own group through the group lane,
 *   which is operational and which nobody can unsubscribe from.
 *
 *   AN ADMISSIONS REVIEWER gets nothing here either. Admissions is a separate
 *   lane from the cohort (locked decision) and reading applications has never
 *   granted the ability to mail the people who were admitted.
 *
 * A UI gate looser than the route's would show a door that opens onto a 403,
 * and one tighter would hide a lane someone is entitled to; the route re-derives
 * it from the same documents and remains the real boundary.
 *
 * Redirects, never 403s: someone guessing run ids learns nothing about which
 * ones exist.
 *
 * ── NOTHING IS COUNTED HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Unlike the cohort-email shell, which has to hand its composer a subscriber
 * count before a word is typed, this page passes only the run's label and the
 * caller's admin flag. Everything else — the week, the recipient count, the
 * rendered subject and body, the session line, and whether this week's nudge
 * has already gone — comes from ONE authenticated GET the panel makes, so the
 * numbers on screen and the numbers the send route will use are read from the
 * same place at the same moment.
