/**
 * The data half of `/learn/[runId]/progress`. Split from `page.tsx` only
 * because the gate is server-side and the data is client-side — a module is
 * either "use client" or it is not, so the two cannot share a file.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE DENOMINATOR COMES FROM ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The overview payload's week INDEX carries titles and publish flags but no
 * item counts, so a bar built from it alone would have a numerator and no
 * denominator — which is not progress, it is a tally. The week docs
 * themselves are `allow read: if isSignedIn()` in the rules (both the run's
 * and a group's forks), so this reads them directly: no route needed, and the
 * counts are the real ones.
 *
 * ── AND WHOSE DEFINITION THAT IS (V2-3, decision 6) ─────────────────────────
 * THE GROUP'S. `useRunWeekItems` used to read `courseRuns/{runId}/weeks` alone
 * while the row TITLES beside its numbers came from the overview's fork-overlaid
 * index — so a member of a group whose facilitator had swapped a week's
 * materials read their own week's title above the RUN's item count. Decision 6
 * is explicit that denominators come from the group's current definition
 * (it is the same rule the fork PATCH route's orphan warning leans on when it
 * says orphaned rows are tolerated because "denominators are always recomputed
 * from the group's current week definition"), so the ids are resolved
 * group-first here too and the two halves of a row describe one document.
 *
 * THE CHEAPER OF THE TWO HONEST FIXES, stated: the overview already sends
 * `forkedWeekIds`, so this hook reads the group's fork subcollection ONLY when
 * that list is non-empty — one extra `getDocs` for a group that has
 * personalised something, and NONE at all for the overwhelmingly common group
 * that has not. The alternative was to put item ids in the overview payload,
 * which would have meant shipping every week's full item list to every member
 * on every run-home mount, for a page most of them never open.
 *
 * Completion is counted against the CURRENT item list rather than by grouping
 * progress rows on `weekNumber`: a row left behind by a material the author
 * has since deleted would otherwise push a week past 100%.
 *
 * Optional materials are excluded from every denominator — that is the
 * meaning of the flag (see `Material.optional`), not a choice made here.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * to this file on purpose: it exists to supply a denominator on one page, and a
 * week page that needs the full week document wants the document, not this
 * projection of it.
 *
 * `source` is the same pair `useWeek` resolves against — the reader's group and
 * the ids of the weeks it has forked, both straight off the overview payload,
 * neither derivable client-side. `null` means the overview has not landed yet,
 * and the hook reports `loading` rather than counting the run's items and
 * swapping the numbers under the reader a moment later.
 *
 * A fork REPLACES its canonical week by doc id — the fork route copies through
 * `templateWeekFields`, so ids and `weekNumber` survive it — which is exactly
 * how `resolveWeekDocs` overlays them server-side for the overview's own index.
 * Same overlay, same order, so the count and the title on a row agree.
 *
 * Key-tagged state (the `useRunProgress` idiom) so `loading` derives on a run
 * or group switch instead of being reset by a setState in the effect body.
