/**
 * The run home — the page a learner opens daily, and the stage for the
 * WeekRail's once-per-session draw.
 *
 * ROUTING IS THIS FILE'S WHOLE JOB. It resolves the caller's role on this run
 * and decides where they belong; everything visible lives in `RunHome`, a
 * client component, because the learning space's data moves under the reader
 * and the draw is a mount-time effect.
 *
 *   canLearn                    → the cohort view
 *   reviewer / track lead only  → /admissions, their entire surface on this
 *                                 run. Admissions is a separate lane from the
 *                                 cohort (locked decision, stated from the
 *                                 other side in the overview route): reviewing
 *                                 applications grants no sight of the people
 *                                 who were admitted.
 *   anyone else                 → /learn — a plain redirect rather than a 403,
 *                                 so a guessed run id reveals nothing about
 *                                 whether that run exists.
 *
 * The redirects are convenience, not the boundary: every route behind them
 * re-derives access from the session, so a member who reaches a surface they
 * shouldn't sees an error, not someone else's cohort.
