/**
 * Server shell for the facilitator review queue: one group, one week's
 * exercises, everyone in it.
 *
 * ── THE GATE IS TWO CHECKS, NOT ONE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `[runId]/layout.tsx` has already established that the caller holds SOME role
 * on this run. That is nowhere near enough here: a learner, an admissions
 * reviewer and a facilitator of a DIFFERENT group all pass that bar, and none
 * of them may read this group's work. So this page re-reads the group document
 * and requires the caller's uid to be on `facilitatorUids` — group membership
 * cannot be inferred from the run, and the whole point of small groups is that
 * they are small.
 *
 * The group must also belong to THIS run. Group ids are top-level, so without
 * that check a facilitator could splice their own group id into another run's
 * URL; the check costs nothing and closes the shape.
 *
 * Admins bypass both, including the archived-group filter — an archived cohort
 * is exactly the thing an admin is asked to go back and look at.
 *
 * ── ARCHIVING A GROUP UNSTAFFS IT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * ONE RULE, and the exercises route behind this page states the same one (see
 * its gate): a non-admin reads a group they facilitate only while it is LIVE.
 * Not the kinder "past work stays readable" lane, deliberately — `runAccess.ts`
 * already withholds facilitator status for an archived group, so someone whose
 * only group is archived never reaches this layout at all, and the run overview
 * has already dropped the card that links here. A page-level exception could
 * not deliver that kindness; it would only make this gate and the route
 * disagree about the same people, which is the state this replaced.
 *
 * Redirects, never 403s: someone guessing group ids learns nothing about which
 * ones exist. And this gate is a UI gate — the exercises and review ROUTES
 * re-derive the same access from the same documents, and are the actual
 * boundary.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
