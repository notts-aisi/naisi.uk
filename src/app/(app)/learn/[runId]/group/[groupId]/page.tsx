/**
 * Server shell for the facilitator's group page: who is in the group, when it
 * meets, and the attendance register.
 *
 * ── THE GATE IS TWO CHECKS, NOT ONE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `[runId]/layout.tsx` has already established that the caller holds SOME role
 * on this run. That is nowhere near enough here: a learner, an admissions
 * reviewer and a facilitator of a DIFFERENT group all pass that bar, and none
 * of them may mark this group's register. So this page re-reads the group
 * document and requires the caller's uid to be on `facilitatorUids` — group
 * membership cannot be inferred from the run, and the whole point of small
 * groups is that they are small.
 *
 * The group must also belong to THIS run. Group ids are top-level, so without
 * that check a facilitator could splice their own group id into another run's
 * URL; the check costs nothing and closes the shape.
 *
 * ── ARCHIVING A GROUP UNSTAFFS IT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * ONE RULE, stated identically here, in the review page beside it, in the
 * routes behind both, and in `runAccess.ts`: a non-admin reads a group they
 * facilitate only while it is LIVE. Admins bypass it — an archived cohort is
 * exactly the thing an admin is asked to go back and look at.
 *
 * Redirects, never 403s: someone guessing group ids learns nothing about which
 * ones exist. And this is a UI gate — the roster, attendance and email ROUTES
 * re-derive the same access from the same documents and are the real boundary.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ── WHY THE SESSION IS RESOLVED HERE AND NOT FETCHED ────────────────────────
 * The roster route deliberately does NOT carry the meeting link (group docs
 * are read-locked to the authoring tier precisely because they hold it), and
 * the run overview only ever describes ONE group — the caller's own, which for
 * someone facilitating two groups is neither of the ones they are looking at.
 * So the session card is fed from the group document this gate has already
 * read, with the Admin SDK, after establishing that the reader is a
 * facilitator of this group or an admin: the two people the overview route
 * also lets see a meeting link.
