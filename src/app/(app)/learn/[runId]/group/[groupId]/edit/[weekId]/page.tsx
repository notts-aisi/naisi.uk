/**
 * Server shell for one week of one group's curriculum.
 *
 * The gate is the edit index's gate, restated rather than shared for the same
 * reason every other page under `group/[groupId]` restates it: a facilitator of
 * THIS group while it is live, or an admin. Being on the run, reviewing its
 * applications, or facilitating a different group are all insufficient, and
 * archiving a group unstaffs it. Redirects, never 403s.
 *
 * ── THE WEEK MUST BE IN THIS GROUP'S SCHEDULE ───────────────────────────────
 * `weekId` is checked against the RESOLVED calendar — the group's own plan when
 * it has one, the run's otherwise — not against the run's plan. A group that
 * has taken a week out of its schedule is a group whose facilitator should not
 * be editing that week's content: it is not something their members will ever
 * see, and letting the URL through would produce a fork nobody reads. Anything
 * that is not a slot in the group's plan goes back to the index.
 *
 * The session, its per-week mode, and the group's pace overrides all live on
 * the group document, which `courseGroups` rules keep away from a plain
 * facilitator's client. They are read here, after the gate, and handed down.
