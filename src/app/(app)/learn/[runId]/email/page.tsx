/**
 * Server shell for the cohort announcement composer — the ANNOUNCEMENT lane.
 * Its twin is `/learn/[runId]/group/[groupId]/email`, the operational one, and
 * the same component serves both with a different audience.
 *
 * ── THE GATE IS NARROWER THAN THE LAYOUT'S, AND NARROWER THAN THE GROUP
 *    PAGE'S ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A RUN facilitator (named on `runFacilitatorUids`), a TRACK LEAD, or an
 * admin. Nobody else — and the two exclusions are deliberate, not oversights:
 *
 *   A GROUP FACILITATOR gets nothing here. Facilitating one room of a run does
 *   not make you the person who addresses all of it; that facilitator mails
 *   their own group through the group lane, which is operational and which
 *   nobody can unsubscribe from.
 *
 *   AN ADMISSIONS REVIEWER gets nothing here either. Admissions is a separate
 *   lane from the cohort (locked decision) and reading applications has never
 *   granted the ability to mail the people who were admitted.
 *
 * This is BYTE-FOR-BYTE the predicate the send route enforces — `isAdmin ||
 * runFacilitatorUids ∪ trackLeadUids` — and it has to stay that way: a UI gate
 * looser than the route's would show a door that opens onto a 403, and one
 * tighter would hide a lane someone is entitled to. The route re-derives it
 * from the same documents and remains the real boundary.
 *
 * Redirects, never 403s: someone guessing run ids learns nothing about which
 * ones exist.
 *
 * ── WHY THE COUNT IS TAKEN HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The composer will not let a real send through without a number it can put in
 * front of the author, and there is no client-readable source for this one:
 * `subscriptions` is server-only, and the cohort's audience is the
 * `cohort:<runId>` channel rather than the enrolment list (an unsubscribe has
 * to actually take effect). So the shell counts the rows with the SAME helper
 * the send route resolves its recipients with — one source of truth for who is
 * on the channel — and passes a bare number across. No address reaches the
 * client.
 *
 * The number is an UPPER BOUND, and the composer says "up to" for that reason:
 * the route dedupes, drops anyone who has turned course announcements off, and
 * drops suppressed addresses, all after this count is taken. Counting rows
 * cannot over-report by any other route, so "up to N" is the honest claim.
 * A failed count passes `null`, which BLOCKS the real send rather than
 * guessing — the same thing an unloadable roster does on the group lane.
