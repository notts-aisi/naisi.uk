/**
 * The admin mount of the group-allocation board.
 *
 * Thin on purpose: `courses/layout.tsx` gates the tree server-side with
 * `requireCourseAuthorPage()` (admin, `draftCourse` or `approveCourse`), so
 * this page owes nothing but the breadcrumb and the board.
 *
 * TRACK LEADS: the allocation ROUTES are gated to `admin ∪ run.trackLeadUids`,
 * which OVERLAPS this page's gate rather than nesting inside it. A track lead
 * who holds neither course permission cannot open this URL, and a drafter who
 * is not a track lead opens it and gets 403s from the board's own calls. That
 * is deliberate: the ROUTE is the boundary, this page is only one door to it,
 * and the track lead's door is the learn-side mount in P7
 * (`/learn/[runId]/allocation`), which renders this same component against
 * these same routes. RunEditor hides the link for a caller the routes will
 * refuse, so the dead end is not offered in the first place.
