/**
 * The front door to the admin area.
 *
 * This gate used to be `role === "admin"` and nothing else, which made the
 * `draftCourse` and `approveCourse` grants unreachable: a member could be
 * given them and still be bounced off `/admin/courses`. It now admits course
 * permission holders too, so the real per-page enforcement moved down a level:
 * everything outside the course tree sits in the `(admin-only)` route group
 * behind `requireAdminPage()`, and `/admin/courses` repeats its own predicate
 * in `courses/layout.tsx`.
 *
 * The heading and the tab strip follow the caller: a course drafter gets
 * "Course admin" and a single tab, not the full committee console with twelve
 * sections they would only be redirected out of.
 *
 * CLOSED DURING A VIEW-AS SESSION. The course editors under `/admin/courses`
 * write to Firestore CLIENT-DIRECT (`courseMutations.ts` setDoc/updateDoc from
 * CourseEditor, RunEditor, WeekEditor and GroupEditor), so there is no route
 * handler in the path for `assertNotImpersonating()` to sit in, and view-as
 * would record every one of those writes as the member. Now that a member
 * holding `draftCourse` can reach this tree, an admin viewing as that member
 * would land on the authoring surfaces with nothing between them and a write
 * attributed to the wrong person. So the tree renders a notice instead of its
 * children while the marker is live.
 *
 * The notice rather than a redirect is deliberate: view-as exists to answer
 * "what does this member see", and bouncing to /dashboard would answer that
 * question wrongly by implying the member cannot reach the admin area at all.
 * The tab strip still renders for the same reason.
