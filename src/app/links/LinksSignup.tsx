/**
 * The mailing list form on /links, with the three application buttons.
 *
 * Fellowship, facilitator and research incubator applications are not open
 * yet, and the promise the society makes about them is an email when they
 * are. So each button leads to this form rather than to a page that does not
 * exist, and it says which one the person pressed by setting `interest`, which
 * the form appends to the subscription's `source`. That is how the committee
 * can tell forty people waiting on the fellowship from five.
 *
 * The buttons are real anchors to `#mailing-list`. Without JavaScript they
 * still carry the person to the form, which is the part that matters; only
 * the label of what they were waiting for is lost.
 *
 * The consent line above the form says what is being joined in so many words.
 * "Tell me when fellowship applications open" followed by a newsletter would
 * be consent to one thing and delivery of another.
 *
 * The form comes first because it is what most printed codes are for, and the
 * buttons sit lower down and jump back up to it. `children` is whatever the
 * page wants between the two (the upcoming events), rendered on the server.
 *
 * WHEN ONE OPENS, an admin marks it open at /admin/links and gives it an
 * address, and that button becomes a plain link to the application with no
 * "Opens soon" on it. The other two keep leading to the form.
 *
 * The one data prop is `applications`: three booleans and three addresses that
 * the page shows anyway. It takes nothing else on purpose, because everything
 * a Server Component hands a client component is serialised into the public
 * HTML, whether or not the component renders it.
