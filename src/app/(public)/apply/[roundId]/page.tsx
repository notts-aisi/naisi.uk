/**
 * `/apply/[roundId]` - and note WHERE it lives.
 *
 * In `(public)`, not `(app)`, for the same reason the course apply page is:
 * applying is open to any signed-in account INCLUDING role `pending`, and
 * `(app)/layout.tsx` redirects a pending account to `/pending-approval`.
 * Putting this page behind that layout would lock out exactly the people it
 * exists for, the ones who made an account at the fair on Monday.
 *
 * It is also NOT in `src/proxy.ts`'s protected prefixes, deliberately: a
 * signed-out visitor gets the sign-in gate card below, with the return address
 * in the link, rather than a redirect to `/login` from which the round is
 * invisible. Discovery matters here; the routes behind the form do the real
 * enforcement.
 *
 * ## Everything is loaded here, on the server
 *
 * `admissionRounds`, its `stages` subcollection and `admissionApplications`
 * are all `allow read, write: if false`, so there is no client-direct read to
 * fall back on. Rather than have the island fetch on mount and flash a
 * spinner at somebody standing in a queue, the page reads all three through
 * the Admin SDK and hands the island its opening state. The same serialisers
 * the API routes use are called here, so the two cannot disagree about what an
 * applicant may see, and the release filter is applied in exactly one place.
 *
 * ## The one thing a view-as session does not get to see
 *
 * Admin "view as" is a full impersonation: the session cookie is the target's,
 * so this page renders the member's own application, which is the whole point
 * of the tool. The exception is the access-requirements answer. It lives in
 * `admissionApplicationPrivate` because it will in practice carry disability
 * and health information, and the privacy policy promises that the people who
 * can open it are the final decider and site admins, through a route that
 * records the read. An admin who is standing in a member's session is neither
 * of those, so the join is skipped while a view-as session is live and the
 * field renders empty. `GET .../apply` refuses outright for the same reason.

 * about NAISI's plans that a visitor has no business reading off a page.
 *
 * `joinPrivate` is the view-as switch. Impersonation swaps the session cookie
 * for the TARGET's, so `uid` here is the member's during a view-as session and
 * the private join would put their access-requirements answer, in practice
 * disability and health information, on an admin's screen with nothing
 * recording the read. During a live view-as the join is skipped and the field
 * renders as the empty string, which is the same thing the page shows an
 * applicant who never answered it.
