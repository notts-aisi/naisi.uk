/**
 * THE PUBLIC PROGRAMME PAGE.
 *
 * Built on `coursePages/{courseId}` (the authored pitch) plus the course, its
 * runs and the admission round that places people onto them. Three rules
 * decide almost everything below:
 *
 * 1. THE ROUND OWNS THE DATES. `courseRuns.admissionRoundIds` does not exist
 *    yet, so the live round is derived at read time by asking which rounds
 *    name one of this course's runs (`fetchLiveRound.ts`). `roundOwnsDates`
 *    decides whether it or the run's own window speaks, and it is the same
 *    helper the catalogue asks. When the round speaks, the CTA points at
 *    `/apply/[roundId]` and every date on the page comes from the round OR
 *    from the run the round will place people onto (`roundTargetRun`), which
 *    is not the same run as the featured one and is normally still `draft`.
 *    When no round speaks, the page falls back to the featured run's own
 *    application window, or to the enrolment window and the session picker for
 *    an open-enrolment pre-course. Two objects naming the same deadline is the
 *    drift V3 exists to stop, so exactly one of them is read per render.
 *
 * 2. NO RAW `run.label` REACHES A VISITOR. The cohort is named by
 *    `cohortLabel(run)` and by nothing else. `run.label` survives on the
 *    document for admin lists; a run with no structured cohort simply gets no
 *    chip, because falling back to the admin handle is what the formatter
 *    exists to prevent.
 *
 * 3. ONE dangerouslySetInnerHTML, AND IT IS `BlockView`. The pitch blocks are
 *    authored copy, sanitised at the write end by the page route and again at
 *    the read end by `normalizeCoursePage`. Every other string on this page
 *    (themes, FAQ, journey labels, the facts rail) is a text node.
 *
 * The sample week renders through `WeekCurriculum` with NO optional props, so
 * its byte-identical public contract holds and the week page and this page
 * cannot drift apart. `tests/course-programme-page.test.mjs` pins that.
 */

 * whose share is almost always a link in a group chat is small. The per-track
 * difference lives in the TITLE and the DESCRIPTION, which is the part a
