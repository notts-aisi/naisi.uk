/**
 * The sitemap, currently the COURSES tree.
 *
 * ## Why courses and not the whole site
 *
 * The programme pages are the only public surface where discovery matters and
 * where the URLs are not otherwise reachable in one hop: a course's week pages
 * are linked from the sample-week section and from each other, which is a
 * chain a crawler has to walk rather than a list it can read. The rest of the
 * public site (home, news, events, resources) is linked from the header and
 * the footer on every page, so it needs no help being found and a hand-listed
 * copy of it here would be a second thing to keep in step with the nav.
 *
 * The two roots are included because a sitemap whose every entry hangs off an
 * unlisted parent is a sitemap missing its own tree.
 *
 * `/links` is the one other page listed, by the same reasoning turned round:
 * it is deliberately NOT in the header or the footer (it is where printed QR
 * codes and the Instagram bio land), so nothing on the site links to it and a
 * crawler has no other way to find it.
 *
 * ## What is NOT in here, deliberately
 *
 *  - Unpublished courses and unpublished weeks. `fetchCourses.ts` filters on
 *    both, and this file inherits that obligation: a sitemap is a published
 *    list of URLs, so leaking a draft course's id here would be worse than
 *    leaking it on a page, not better.
 *  - `/apply` and `/applications`. They are personal, they change with a
 *    round's window, and there is nothing for a crawler to index behind them.
 *  - `/admin` and every authed surface, which `robots.ts` does not need to
 *    exclude precisely because nothing links or lists them.
 *
 * Errors are swallowed to an empty list rather than thrown: a sitemap that
 * 500s is a worse outcome than a sitemap that is briefly short, and this runs
 * against the Admin SDK, which is absent in a build with no credentials.
 *
 * ## Its own fetcher
 *
 * `listCourseSitemapRows()` rather than the catalogue's entry builder. That
 * one exists to draw cards: it runs two site-wide run queries, scans every
 * admission round and batches `coursePages` for the artwork, and the sitemap
 * then added one `getPublishedCourse` per course on top of it for the weeks.
 * A crawler wants ids and week numbers, so it asks for ids and week numbers.
 */
/**
 * Rendered PER REQUEST, not at build.
 *
 * Without this Next prerenders `sitemap.xml` as static content, and the build
 * runs with no Admin SDK credentials: `listPublishedCourses()` returns an
 * empty list, the empty result is frozen into the deployment, and the sitemap
 * would then never mention a course again however many are published. A
 * sitemap is fetched by a crawler a few times a day, so the cost of building
 * it live is nothing and the cost of getting it wrong is the whole feature.
