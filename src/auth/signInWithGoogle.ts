 * Why GIS instead of signInWithPopup / signInWithRedirect:
 *
 * Both Firebase Auth client flows depend on cross-origin iframes or
 * popups loading accounts.google.com — content blockers, ad-blockers,
 * and VPN tracking-protection routinely block those, leaving the user
 * stuck on /login with no signal. GIS uses FedCM in modern browsers
 * (Safari 17.4+, Chrome 117+) which is a browser-native API that
 * extensions can't intercept, and falls back to a top-level redirect on
 * older browsers. The credential comes back as an ID token JWT we hand
 * to Firebase via GoogleAuthProvider.credential — Firebase Auth signs
 * the user in client-side without any extra round trips.
 *
 * Server-side `exists` (returned by /api/auth/session) is the source of
 * truth for the new-vs-existing-user routing decision — a client-side
 * Firestore read here would race the fresh auth token attachment.
