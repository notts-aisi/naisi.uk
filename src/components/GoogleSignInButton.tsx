   * web.dev). GIS logs a popup failure to the console and its credential
   * callback never fires, so without this the tap is a completely silent dead
   * end and the user is left staring at a button that appears to do nothing.
   * The same wrapper also catches an ordinary desktop popup blocker.
   *
   * Scoped to accounts.google.com so an unrelated blocked popup elsewhere on
   * the page cannot produce a misleading sign-in error, and reported at most
   * once so repeated taps do not stack messages. The original is restored on
