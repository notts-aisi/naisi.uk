/**
 * Which piece of printed material, and which button, a sign-up came from.
 *
 * A QR code on a flyer encodes `naisi.uk/q/<slug>`, and the redirect in
 * `next.config.ts` lands the scan on a page carrying `?q=<slug>`. Nothing is
 * stored on the visitor's device and nothing is recorded about the scan
 * itself: the marker rides in the URL for one visit, and if that person
 * chooses to join the mailing list it becomes the `source` of the subscription
 * they are knowingly submitting. `source` already exists on every subscription
 * row and the admin Subscriptions table already shows and exports it, so
 * "which flyer worked" is answerable with no new field, no cookie and no
 * change to the privacy policy.
 *
 * The strings this builds:
 *
 *   homepage                 the form on the home page, no code involved
 *   links                    the form on /links, no code involved
 *   links:fellowship         ...after pressing the fellowship button there
 *   qr:flyer                 arrived from the code whose slug is "flyer"
 *   qr:flyer:fellowship      ...and pressed the fellowship button
 *
 * Everything here is client-supplied text, so both parts are held to a closed
 * shape before they are sent. The subscriptions route clamps `source` to 80
 * characters and treats it as a label, never as an authorisation input.
 */

 * A printed slug: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, sixteen at most.
