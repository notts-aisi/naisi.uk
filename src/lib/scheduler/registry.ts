/**
 * The scheduler job registry.
 *
 * Jobs are MODULES, not HTTP routes. There are exactly two scheduler
 * endpoints (POST /api/scheduler/tick and POST /api/admin/scheduler/run)
 * and everything else is an entry in `JOBS` below. A per-job route would mean
 * a per-job secret surface, a per-job timeout and a per-job "is it armed?"
 * question; a registry entry means one endpoint to protect and one panel to
 * read.
 *
 * ORDER IS ALPHABETICAL BY JOB ID, and that is the whole rule. `JOBS` is the
 * one line every job-adding PR touches, so a merge-friendly order beats an
 * editorial one: alphabetical gives each new entry exactly one correct
 * position and several branches appending in parallel stop conflicting in the
 * same place.
 *
 * Nothing depends on the position. The budget is checked BEFORE each job
 * runs, a job the tick could not reach is reported as skipped for budget on
 * the receipt and picked up by the re-arm, and every job derives its due
 * state from live data at tick time rather than from a stored queue, so
 * nothing is lost by being last. In particular the heartbeat is no longer
 * first: what proves the tick is alive is the RECEIPT, which is written
 * whether or not the heartbeat was reached.
 *
 * ADDING A JOB (later PRs): write `src/lib/scheduler/jobs/<name>.ts`
 * exporting a `JobRegistration`, import it here, and splice it into `JOBS` in
 * id order. The
 * `SchedulerJobId` union already names every job the courses V3 contract
 * plans, so a new entry needs no type change. That is deliberate: the panel
 * and `config/scheduler` key on those ids, and renaming one after it has
 * shipped orphans its stored enable switch.
