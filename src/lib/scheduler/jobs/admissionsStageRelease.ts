/**
 * `admissions-stage-release`: the note that goes out when the next part of a
 * round's form opens.
 *
 * ## It announces something that has already happened
 *
 * This job does NOT release anything. `isStageReleased`
 * (`src/lib/admissions/stageRelease.ts`) derives the release at read time, on
 * every serialisation of every stage, so the questions are already on the
 * applicant's form before this handler is reached. A tick that never ran, a
 * scheduler somebody switched off, a send that bounced: none of them can gate
 * a question behind an email. That is the whole reason the release lives in a
 * predicate and the announcement lives here, and it is why a missed send is a
 * missed email rather than a fairness incident.
 *
 * ## ONE MARKER PER RECIPIENT, exactly as the deadline reminder does
 *
 * `stagerel__{roundId}__{stageId}__{uid}`, claimed with `.create()` before
 * that person's send and stamped after it.
 *
 * An earlier shape claimed ONE marker for the whole stage and carried a
 * resume cursor on it. Two things were wrong with that, and both bit at the
 * size a real intake reaches rather than in a test:
 *
 *  1. **The attempt budget was spent on ordinary runs.** A claim is capped at
 *     three attempts, and a round bigger than one tick's send ceiling needs a
 *     re-claim per partial run. So a round over roughly ninety live
 *     applications used its three attempts up on healthy partial runs, was
 *     given up on with a "no send" failure it had not had, and the last
 *     applicants were never told. The budget, not the ceiling, was the binding
 *     constraint.
 *  2. **The cursor was one document written once per recipient.** Firestore
 *     sustains about one write per second per document, and the write was
 *     swallowed on failure, so under load the cursor quietly stopped moving
 *     and a re-claim re-mailed people who had already had the email.
 *
 * A per-recipient marker has neither problem: each person carries their own
 * attempt budget, their own skip reason and their own stamp, no document is
 * written more than a couple of times, and a run that stops halfway simply
 * finds the first half already marked next time.
 *
 * ## The order is claim, send, stamp
 *
 * `.create()` the person's marker BEFORE their send, `stampSent` after it. A
 * crash in between leaves an unstamped marker, which the re-claim rule picks
 * up on a later tick; the reverse order would turn the same crash into a
 * second copy.
 *
 * ## One bad recipient costs one recipient, and IS retried
 *
 * Every per-recipient step is inside a try/catch and the run carries on. A
 * send that failed leaves its own marker unstamped (`stampError` writes only
 * `lastError`), so the re-claim rule picks that one person up on a later tick
 * without touching anybody else. That is a change from the stage-marker
 * shape, which could not retry one person at all.
 *
 * ## Too late is not worth saying
 *
 * `maxLateHours` is 72, three times the deadline reminder's window, because
 * this is an announcement rather than a countdown: a stage that opened
 * yesterday is still news. Past that, ONE stage-level marker
 * (`stagerel__{roundId}__{stageId}`) is written already settled as
 * `skippedReason: "stale"` and nobody is mailed. It is written with
 * {@link createSettled} and never with `claim()`: it records a verdict rather
 * than authorising a side effect, so it must not spend an attempt. Neither
 * the tick nor the release button sends afterwards, because both re-derive
 * the same verdict from the same clock.
 *
 * ## Lateness is measured from when the stage could first be seen
 *
 * A stage may be scheduled for a date BEFORE the round's window opens (an
 * author sets every stage's date up front, then moves the opening back). Its
 * questions cannot be read until the round opens, so measuring lateness from
 * the schedule alone would stamp it stale on the very day it first became
 * visible. {@link stageAnnouncedAt} therefore takes the LATER of the two.
 *
 * ## A stage that opens WITH the round is not announced
 *
 * `releaseAt: null` means "this stage is the form". It becomes readable the
 * moment the round's window opens, which is the same moment the round's own
 * announcement, its public page and its apply link are the news. Mailing
 * "stage one is now open" to somebody already halfway through writing it
 * would be noise, so a stage with neither a schedule nor a manual release
 * claims no marker and sends nothing.
 *
 * ## It also pushes, and only alongside the email
 *
 * Settled by the owner on 6 September 2026: the announcement goes by email
 * AND push, which is what the V3 contract had always said and what an
 * earlier guard had pinned as "never" while the question was open.
 *
 * The push rides the email rather than running beside it. It is sent from
 * inside `mailCandidate`, after a send this job has counted and before that
 * person's stamp, through `mirrorCourseDecisionToPush`: the SAME shared
 * sender the decision push and (by way of its task sibling) every task email
 * use. There is no bespoke path here, so the account switch, the VAPID gate,
 * the dead-subscription prune and the fresh-subscription grace are all read
 * from one place.
 *
 * Four consequences worth naming:
 *
 *  - **One push per announcement, never more.** The per-recipient marker is
 *    claimed before both legs and stamped after both, so a retried tick that
 *    finds a settled marker sends neither. Nobody is pushed on a stage twice.
 *  - **A push failure costs the push.** The mirror is documented never to
 *    throw; the call is wrapped anyway, counted in `pushFailed` and logged.
 *    It is never added to `summary.failures`, which is the EMAIL accounting
 *    the release receipt renders, and it never leaves a marker unstamped:
 *    re-mailing a whole round because a push service was down is the trade
 *    nobody would take.
 *  - **A recipient with no device costs one query and nothing else.** A
 *    recipient whose MAILBOX stopped the email (suppressed, no address) is not
 *    pushed either, so push volume stays bounded by the audience the email
 *    already has rather than by a new one. A recipient who switched the
 *    courses EMAIL cell off is the one skip that still pushes, because that
 *    cell is one of the row's two and reading it as a refusal of both would
 *    make the push cell mean nothing. See {@link mailCandidate}.
 *  - **It lands where the email lands**, on the form the new questions are
 *    answered on, by the same `admissionApplicationPath` the email's button
 *    is built from.

 * goes through. A scheduler job reaching `sendPushToUid` (or web-push) on its
 * own would be a second copy of all four, one of which would be wrong first.
 *
 * SHORT, AND SAFE ON A LOCK SCREEN. The round's name and the stage's title,
 * which is exactly what the applicant needs to know it is about them and
 * where to go. Nothing else on the stage is theirs to leak: the questions,
 * the intro and the deadline stay behind the account, on a surface they
 * chose to open.
 *
 * ABSENT PREFERENCES ARE A YES, which is what makes this work for an
 * applicant who is not a member. `normaliseNotifications` resolves an
 * unwritten push map to both keys on and a missing user doc reads the same
 * way, exactly as the task mirror already relies on; a device had to be
 * enabled by its owner for any of this to send anything at all.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS. The mirror swallows its own failures, and this wraps it
 * anyway: a push service having a bad day must not cost this person their
 * stamp, because an unstamped marker is a re-claim, and a re-claim is a
 * second email.
