/**
 * The heartbeat job.
 *
 * It sends nothing, writes nothing and claims no marker. Its entire purpose
 * is to be the FIRST registered job so that the machinery around jobs (the
 * secret check, the receipt id scheme, the config kill switch, the budget,
 * the re-arm and the admin panel) is exercised on every tick and visible on
 * the panel before any real send depends on it.
 *
 * "Is the scheduler running" must be answerable from a surface, not from Cloud
 * Logging, and the heartbeat receipts on the panel are that answer.
 *
 * `processed: 1` rather than 0 on purpose: a receipt whose only job reports
 * zero work is indistinguishable from a receipt whose job never ran, and the
 * whole point of this job is to be distinguishable.
 *
 * The type-only import of `JobRegistration` keeps the registry/handler pair
 * free of a runtime cycle.
