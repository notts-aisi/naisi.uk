/**
 * THE UNMARKED-REGISTER FOLLOW-UP JOB.
 *
 * A facilitator who never presses PUSH ATTENDANCE takes two things from their
 * group at once: the register (so every member carries a session in a
 * denominator reviewers read as a shortfall) and the next week's reminder
 * email, which the push is what sends. Before this job the only way to notice
 * was to open the group's register and look. Now a card lands on every admin's
 * committee board once the grace has passed.
 *
 * The arithmetic (the window, the "unmarked" predicate, the cursor, the task
 * payload, the read-back decision) is PURE and lives in
 * `src/lib/courses/unmarkedRegisters.ts` with its own unit suite. This file is
 * the Firestore half: what it reads, in what order, and what it does when the
 * id it wants is already taken.
 *
 * ── THE SCAN WINDOW ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Sessions whose END instant is between the grace
 * (`config/courses.unmarkedRegisterGraceHours`, default 36) and the grace plus
 * 24 hours, over runs whose status is in `NUDGING_STATUSES`.
 *
 * NOT `running` ALONE, and that is not a widening for its own sake. The
 * pre-course opens on 21 September and runs its six sessions while the
 * admission round is still open, so its run sits at `applications-open` for
 * the whole of it. Scanning `running` only would mean the ONE cohort this job
 * exists for, brand-new facilitators marking their first ever register, is the
 * one cohort it never looks at.
 *
 * ── THE READ BUDGET IS THE REAL CEILING ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `maxFollowUpTasksPerTick` caps WRITES, and writes are not where a tick runs
 * out of time: a quiet week writes nothing at all and still walks every run,
 * every group and every session in the band. So the scan carries its own
 * wall-clock budget (`config/courses.unmarkedScanBudgetMs`, floored by
 * whatever the tick has left) and a RESUMABLE CURSOR over the run list. Out of
 * time means "stop, remember the last run finished, report hasMore"; the
 * re-arm or the next tick picks the list up after it. A run interrupted
 * part-way through does NOT advance the cursor: it is rescanned from its first
 * group next time, which costs reads and writes nothing, because every unit of
 * work is guarded by its own marker.
 *
 * ── ORDER, WHICH IS NOT NEGOTIABLE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. claim the marker `unmarked__{groupId}__{sessionKey}` with `.create()`;
 *   2. mint the task;
 *   3. stamp `sentAt`.
 * Claim first turns a crash into a MISSED card (recoverable by the re-claim
 * rule) rather than into a second card on every admin's board.
 *
 * ── ONE BAD ITEM NEVER THROWS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A group with a corrupt calendar, a run whose document vanished mid-scan, a
 * task id that is already taken: each is recorded on its own marker or in the
 * log and the scan carries on. That holds at all three levels: a session whose
 * claim or stamp throws, a group whose register read throws, and a run whose
 * whole scan throws are each caught where they happen, counted into the pass's
 * summary, and followed by the next unit of work. The only throw that escapes
 * this file is one from the reads before the loop, which means the database
 * itself is unavailable and is the tick's to report.
 *
 * A run that throws is NOT marked finished, so the cursor does not advance
 * over it and the next full pass reaches it again. A run that keeps throwing
 * is counted (`config/schedulerCursors`, this job's `failures` map) and, after
 * {@link MAX_RUN_SCAN_FAILURES} consecutive passes, stepped over so one
 * poisoned cohort cannot spend the whole term's budget failing. Stepping over
 * is logged every pass it happens, and the count resets the moment the run
 * scans cleanly.
