/**
 * `admissions-deadline-reminders`: the nudge to everybody still holding an
 * UNSUBMITTED draft on an open round.
 *
 * ## Nothing is scheduled
 *
 * There is no stored due list and no rescheduling step. Every tick reads each
 * open round's `closesAt` and its `reminderOffsets` and derives the due
 * instants again (`src/lib/admissions/reminderSchedule.ts`), so an admin who
 * moves a deadline moves every reminder with it, and a tick that never fired
 * costs latency rather than a send.
 *
 * ## The marker keys on the RESOLVED civil date
 *
 * `remind__{roundId}__{uid}__{dueAtKey}`, where `dueAtKey` is the London
 * civil date the reminder resolved to, never the offset id. Two consequences,
 * both wanted: editing the schedule cannot re-mail a date that has already
 * gone out, and two offsets that resolve to the same day are one email rather
 * than two.
 *
 * ## The order is claim, send, stamp
 *
 * `.create()` the marker BEFORE the send, `stampSent` after it. A crash in
 * between leaves an unstamped marker, which the re-claim rule picks up on a
 * later tick; the reverse order would turn the same crash into a duplicate,
 * and a duplicate deadline email to two hundred freshers is the failure
 * people talk about. `sendAdmissionEmail` returns its outcome for exactly
 * this reason: a send that threw must not be stamped as sent.
 *
 * ## One bad unit of work costs one unit of work
 *
 * Every per-candidate step is inside a try/catch: the claim, the users read,
 * the suppression read, the send and both stamps. A transient Firestore error
 * on applicant four is recorded against applicant four and the run carries
 * on, rather than throwing out of the handler and costing the other hundred
 * and ninety-six their reminder. The one step with a second attempt is the
 * `sentAt` stamp, because that is the only failure that can turn into a
 * DUPLICATE rather than a missed send (see `stampSentOrSettle`).
 *
 * ## Too late is worse than silent
 *
 * `maxLateHours` is 24. A "closes in 7 days" email that lands three days
 * after the deadline is worse than no email, so work older than that is
 * stamped `skippedReason: "stale"` and nobody is mailed. The stale stamp is
 * ONE MARKER PER ROUND AND RESOLVED DATE rather than one per applicant: it is
 * equally honest (the job would classify every applicant on that date
 * identically, and it re-derives the same verdict every tick, so no send can
 * escape it) and it is a single write instead of two per person. The uid
 * component of that marker is {@link STALE_MARKER_UID}, which cannot collide
 * with a real applicant's marker because a Firebase uid is 28 characters.
 *
 * ## Who is skipped, and why the marker still settles
 *
 * A suppressed address, an explicit courses opt-out, or an applicant with no
 * address on file is stamped `skippedReason` rather than left unmarked. The
 * marker is the record that the person was SEEN and consciously not mailed;
 * leaving it unmarked would mean re-deciding the same thing, and re-reading
 * the same documents, on every tick until the deadline passed.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * The tick can overlap itself (see the re-arm note in the tick route), so
 * this handler must be safe to run beside itself. It is, because the only
 * thing that authorises a send is winning a `.create()` on that person's
 * marker.

   * be armed on whatever data an environment held the moment it deployed.
   * The owner switches it on from Site status once the round is open and a
   * run has been proven on dev (docs/courses-ops.md). Send now refuses while
   * it is off, so the manual lane cannot bypass the dark period by accident.
