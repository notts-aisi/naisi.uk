import "server-only";

/**
 * `event-announcements`: the "we have published a new event" announcement,
 * taken off the publish request.
 *
 * ## WHAT THIS IS FOR
 *
 * `POST /api/events/[id]/publish` has always sent the announcement inline,
 * inside the request that publishes, against App Hosting's 60s timeout. That
 * bought three ceilings (500 junction rows read, 200 messages sent, 500 device
 * rows) and docs/notifications.md has called it "the known limit" ever since,
 * with the answer written down: a list that outgrows those numbers needs the
 * send taken off the request path, as a scheduler job. This is that job.
 *
 * ## TWO PATHS, AND THE SWITCH DECIDES WHICH ONE A PUBLISH TAKES
 *
 * The publish route reads THIS job's switch once, before its transaction. Off
 * (the shipped default) it sends inline exactly as it always has, ceilings and
 * all, and nothing about a publish changes. On, it stamps `announcedAt` as
 * usual and writes `announcementState: "queued"` in the same transaction
 * instead of sending, and this job does the work.
 *
 * SO THIS JOB SHIPS DARK, AND MUST STAY DARK WHERE THE TICK IS NOT ARMED.
 * Switching it on where no scheduler calls `/api/scheduler/tick` would take
 * every publish off the inline path and queue announcements nobody ever
 * delivers, which is worse than the ceiling it replaces. On a backend with no
 * scheduler secret the tick does not run.
 *
 * ## THE CLAIM IS STILL ONCE PER EVENT, AND IT IS STILL `announcedAt`
 *
 * Nothing about the once-per-event claim moves. The publish transaction stamps
 * `announcedAt` before anything is queued, so two racing publishes still
 * produce one announcement and a republish is still not news twice. What the
 * queue adds is a SECOND layer underneath it: one marker per recipient per
 * leg, so exactly-once survives a tick that runs out of budget half way down
 * the list, a container that dies mid-send, and two ticks overlapping (which
 * the re-arm makes ordinary, see the tick route's header).
 *
 * A consequence worth stating: nothing here claims the EVENT. Two ticks may
 * both pick up the same queued event and both walk its audience, where an
 * event-level claim would need its own expiry rule and its own way of going
 * wrong. `announcementState: "sending"` is a progress note, not a lock, and
 * three separate things make the overlap safe rather than one:
 *
 *  - SENDS are exactly-once, through the per-recipient markers: the second
 *    tick's `.create()` on a claimed marker fails with ALREADY_EXISTS.
 *  - COUNTS are increments. Every tick writes its own deltas with
 *    `FieldValue.increment` and never the accumulated totals, so a tick that
 *    read the totals before another tick committed cannot write its work away.
 *  - The STATE TRANSITIONS are transactional. `done` and `refused`, and the
 *    release of `announcedAt` with them, are decided inside a transaction that
 *    re-reads the document and writes only while the announcement is still
 *    pending, so a tick cannot finish an event another tick is still working
 *    on and two ticks cannot both release one claim.
 *
 * ## AN UNSETTLED UNIT KEEPS THE EVENT IN THE QUEUE
 *
 * The scan finds `queued` and `sending` and nothing else, so an event written
 * `done` is an event no later tick will ever look at again. A send that
 * failed, a claim another tick is holding in flight, or anything that threw
 * therefore leaves the event `"sending"` and reports `hasMore`, and the
 * ordinary marker rules take it from there: the re-claim window lets a later
 * tick pick the unit up, and `maxAttempts` ends it. A marker the claim helper
 * gives up on is SETTLED (stamped `failedAt`, counted as a failure), which is
 * what lets an event whose worst recipient cannot be reached still finish
 * rather than re-arming for ever.
 *
 * ## ONE UNIT OF WORK IS ONE RECIPIENT
 *
 * Email: one recipient, all of their addresses (a member with two verified
 * addresses is one unit and two messages, because the unsubscribe token and
 * the marker are per person). Push: one uid. Between units the tick's budget
 * and `maxPerTick` are both checked, and either one stops the run with
 * `hasMore: true`, leaving the event `sending` for the next tick to resume.
 *
 * THE REQUEST PATH'S MESSAGE CEILING DOES NOT APPLY HERE. That is the whole
 * point of the move: a list is delivered over as many ticks as it takes rather
 * than inside one request. What bounds it instead is a sanity ceiling on each
 * of the two READS, because neither is paged:
 * `MAX_QUEUED_ANNOUNCEMENT_ROWS` (5000) on the junction and
 * {@link MAX_QUEUED_PUSH_ROWS} (5000) on the devices, both refused whole
 * rather than truncated. So "any size" is not the claim and never was the
 * right one; up to those ceilings is.
 *
 * BOTH READS ARE MADE AGAIN ON EVERY TICK that touches an event, which is the
 * price of holding no cursor and is paid deliberately: a stored copy of the
 * list would go stale the moment somebody unsubscribed, and the markers make
 * a re-read cost reads rather than duplicate sends. Two things keep the price
 * honest, and both are the budget rather than a cache. The wall clock is
 * checked immediately after each read, so a tick that has nothing left does
 * not walk into a loop it cannot run; and the device scan is not made at all
 * until the email leg has finished everything it is going to do this tick, so
 * a tick spent on email does not also pay for a 5000-row read it will not
 * use. PAGING THE JUNCTION READ is the fix if a list ever nears its ceiling.
 *
 * ## RESUMING WITHOUT RE-CLAIMING, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES A LONG LIST FINISH
 *
 * Every tick starts at the top of the audience, so on a long list most of what
 * it walks is already done. Asking `claim()` about each of those is not free:
 * a settled marker costs a failed `.create()` AND a `runTransaction` read
 * inside the recovery path, roughly three round trips, and it advances no
 * units. Left like that the run STALLS: past somewhere around 900 settled
 * recipients a tick spends its whole 28s budget re-checking the same prefix
 * and never reaches the tail, and the re-arm chain repeats it rather than
 * rescuing it. `MAX_TICK_DEPTH` bounds that chain; it does not fix it.
 *
 * So each tick BULK-READS this event's markers first, in one equality-only
 * query, and skips the recipients whose marker is already settled (sent,
 * skipped, or given up on) without asking `claim()` about them at all. A
 * marker that is CLAIMED BUT UNSTAMPED is deliberately not in that set: those
 * still go through `claim()`, which is where the in-flight rule and the
 * re-claim window live.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS, said plainly: one document read per marker per tick. At the
 * 5000-row ceiling, drained 200 units at a time, that is 25 ticks over up to
 * 10000 markers, on the order of a hundred thousand document reads for one
 * announcement. That is the price of resuming with no cursor, and A CURSOR IS
 * THE FIX if it ever matters. What the prefilter buys is that the list
 * actually finishes, which no amount of re-arming did before it.
 *
 * ## STALE IS MEASURED AGAINST THE EVENT, NOT AGAINST THE QUEUE
 *
 * A queued announcement that is a day late is still worth sending: an event
 * page that went live stays news until the event itself has happened. So there
 * is no lateness bound on the queue at all. What IS refused is an announcement
 * for an event whose `startAt` has passed, because "come to this" about
 * something that already happened is worse than silence.
 *
 * `maxLateHours` is therefore not the ordinary bound, and it is not decoration
 * either: it is the fallback for an event with NO `startAt` (the normaliser
 * produces one from a document whose timestamp is missing or malformed), which
 * would otherwise sit in the queue for ever with nothing able to rule on it.
 *
 * A stale refusal RELEASES NOTHING. `announcedAt` stays stamped, because there
 * is no later moment at which this announcement becomes worth sending and
 * handing the claim back would invite a republish to try again.
 *
 * ## A PURE REFUSAL HANDS THE CLAIM BACK, EXACTLY AS THE INLINE PATH DOES
 *
 * The rule is the publish route's, word for word: the email audience refused
 * AND nothing was sent, failed or pushed. Not "both legs refused": the push
 * leg answers null when it is dormant or nobody has opted in, and requiring a
 * refusal from it too left an unreadable events list finishing `done` with the
 * claim spent and no supported way to get the announcement out.
 *
 * It is judged on the totals AS STORED, inside the settling transaction, so an
 * event that mailed forty people on Monday and met a refusal on Tuesday keeps
 * its claim, and a stale count cannot release one another tick has spent. An
 * email audience that refused does NOT stop the push leg, because the inline
 * path runs both legs regardless and this path answers the same two questions.
 *
 * ## LOGGING
 *
 * By event id and by uid or audience key. Never an address: the log is not the
 * place a mailing list accumulates, and the marker ids are hashed for the same
 * reason (see `announcementRecipientKey`).
