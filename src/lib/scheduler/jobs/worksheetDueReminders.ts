/**
 * `worksheet-due-reminders`: the nudge to everybody who has a worksheet and
 * has not sent it back yet.
 *
 * Modelled on `admissionsReminders.ts`, which is the job in this repo that has
 * already been argued about. Read its header for the reasoning behind the
 * shape; what follows is only what is DIFFERENT here, plus the one decision
 * this job makes on its own.
 *
 * ## Nothing is scheduled, and the sender's slots are the schedule
 *
 * A circulation carries its own reminder list at
 * `notifications.dueSoon.slots` (see `src/lib/reminders/slots.ts`): up to six
 * entries, each a number of days before `dueDate` and a London wall clock on
 * that day. Nothing is stored as a due list. Every tick reads the due date and
 * the slots and resolves them again from scratch through
 * `resolveReminderSlots`, the SAME resolver the admissions deadline reminders
 * use, so moving a deadline moves every reminder with it and a tick that
 * never fired costs latency rather than a send.
 *
 * A circulation stored before the slots existed reads as the defaults (three
 * days out and the day before, both at 10:00), because `normalizeNotifications`
 * fills them in. The two switches remain the on and off: both off and this job
 * skips the circulation before it reads a single response.
 *
 * ## THE SCAN, AND WHY IT STILL FITS ONE INDEX
 *
 * `status == "open"`, then `dueDate` between the start of TODAY in London and
 * `now + {@link SCAN_HORIZON_DAYS}` days, in that clause order, because that
 * is the order of the ONE composite index this feature declares
 * (`circulations (status ASC, dueDate ASC)` in `firestore.indexes.json`).
 * Equality first, then the range field: writing the chain any other way is the
 * same query to Firestore and a different-looking one to
 * `tests/firestore-indexes.test.mjs`.
 *
 * The two bounds are the two things the arithmetic downstream can prove:
 *
 *  - A slot NEVER resolves past the due date (the resolver drops one that
 *    would), so a circulation with any slot due today has a due date that is
 *    either still ahead or earlier TODAY. Reading from the start of the London
 *    civil day rather than from `now` is what keeps that second case in: a
 *    worksheet due at 09:00 with a nudge set for 08:00 is still owed that
 *    nudge at 08:05, and `dueDate >= now` would have dropped the whole
 *    circulation at 09:01 while the reminder was five minutes late rather than
 *    a day late. Yesterday's deadlines are out, which is the boundary this job
 *    promises: a passed day is a passed deadline.
 *  - A slot at most `REMINDER_SLOT_LIMITS.maxDaysBefore` days out means a due
 *    date beyond that horizon cannot have a reminder due yet, so the horizon
 *    costs nothing and keeps the scan cap (below) spent on the circulations
 *    that might actually send.
 *
 * The filtering that the query cannot do is done in code, on the resolved
 * slots: `pending` is left for a later tick, `stale` is dropped, `due` sends.
 *
 * ## The marker keys on the resolved moment, date AND wall clock
 *
 * `wsremind__{circulationId}__{uid}__{dueKey}` where `dueKey` is the London
 * civil date the slot resolved to with its wall clock appended
 * (`2026-10-04T1000`). Three consequences, all wanted:
 *
 *  1. A tick that runs every quarter of an hour sends ONE reminder per slot,
 *     because every tick after the first finds that slot's marker.
 *  2. TWO SLOTS ON ONE DAY at different times are two reminders, which is what
 *     a sender who set 09:00 and 16:00 on the due day asked for. Two slots
 *     resolving to the same moment are one, because they are one key. (This is
 *     the `"instant"` grouping; admissions groups by DAY, where the audience is
 *     an applicant pool rather than a handful of named people.)
 *  3. MOVING THE DEADLINE re-resolves every slot and mints new keys, so people
 *     who still have not submitted are reminded about the new date rather than
 *     silenced by the old date's markers.
 *
 * ## LATENESS IS MEASURED FROM THE SLOT, NEVER FROM THE WINDOW
 *
 * `maxLateHours` (24) is now honoured, and it is measured from the moment the
 * slot itself resolved to. Read that twice, because the bug this replaced was
 * the other reading: an earlier version had a fixed 48-hour window and mapped
 * `maxLateHours` onto the moment that window OPENED, which silenced precisely
 * the reminders that matter most. A deadline less than 24 hours away is, by
 * definition, one whose 48-hour window opened more than 24 hours ago, so a
 * scheduler that had never missed a tick dropped every same-day worksheet,
 * and dropped everybody added inside the last day with it, while the marker
 * said "stale" about a run that was never late.
 *
 * Measured from the slot, the same number says something true: a nudge set for
 * 10:00 on Tuesday is worth sending at 10:05 and not worth sending on
 * Thursday, whatever the deadline is doing. What that costs, said plainly: a
 * recipient added AFTER the last slot has passed gets no reminder at all,
 * where the old window would have found them. The answer to that is a slot on
 * the due day, which the sender can now add, rather than a job that mails
 * people about a schedule nobody set.
 *
 * A stale slot is dropped in code with NO marker written, and that is a
 * deliberate difference from `admissionsReminders.ts`, which stamps one per
 * stale date. A worksheet's slots are days apart, so on the day-before tick
 * the three-day slot is always stale and always ALREADY SENT: a marker saying
 * "dropped as stale" would be a record of a reminder that went out on time.
 * The arithmetic is free to redo every tick, and the per-recipient markers are
 * the record that matters.
 *
 * ## STALE IS THE ORDINARY END OF A DELIVERED REMINDER, SO IT IS REPORTED ONCE
 *
 * Read that heading before touching {@link STALE_REPORT_WINDOW_HOURS}. A slot
 * stays resolvable for as long as its circulation is in the scan, so a
 * reminder that went out perfectly on Monday is still resolving, still past
 * its moment and still classified `stale` on every tick until Thursday. The
 * first version of this job counted and logged each of those, which on a
 * quarter-hourly tick is the same line about the same non-event roughly a
 * hundred times a day, and put the count into `processed`, so the panel
 * showed the job "doing work" on ticks where it did nothing at all. Neither
 * was a wrong email; both were a health readout that cried wolf.
 *
 * So: a stale entry is reported only while it is FRESHLY stale, meaning it
 * crossed the `maxLateHours` bound within the last
 * {@link STALE_REPORT_WINDOW_HOURS}, and it is NOT counted as work in
 * `processed`. What the counter means afterwards is honest and narrow: "a
 * reminder passed the point of being worth sending during this run's window".
 * It is not, and never was, proof that the reminder was missed. Nothing here
 * can know that without reading the audience's markers, which is exactly the
 * work the stale branch exists to skip. The question "has the scheduler been
 * dark" is answered by the scheduler panel's own last-run time, which is the
 * thing that actually knows.
 *
 * ## THIS JOB MAY PUSH
 *
 * Every other mail this platform sends from a tick is email only. The owner
 * asked for an email switch AND a push switch per circulation event, so
 * `notifications.dueSoon` carries both and this job honours them
 * INDEPENDENTLY: email off with push on is a legitimate setting and sends a
 * push. That is a deliberate divergence from `src/lib/worksheets/notify.ts`,
 * whose policy is that push mirrors email and never leads it. The difference
 * is that this job's unit of work is one person's reminder rather than a
 * broadcast, and the marker records what happened to it either way.
 *
 * What is NOT diverged: the site-wide task-email kill switch
 * (`config/taskEmails`) covers the push as well. It is read once per run,
 * before anything is claimed, and a run under a closed switch does nothing at
 * all rather than pushing what it may not mail.
 *
 * ## One bad recipient costs one recipient
 *
 * Every per-recipient step is inside a try/catch: the claim, the users read,
 * the suppression read, the send and both stamps. The order is the one that
 * cannot duplicate: claim, send, stamp. A crash in the middle leaves an
 * unstamped marker, which a later tick re-claims after
 * `reclaimAfterMinutes`; the reverse order would turn the same crash into a
 * second reminder.
