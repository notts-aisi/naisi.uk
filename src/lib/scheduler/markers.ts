/**
 * Claim-before-send against `schedulerMarkers`.
 *
 * The id builders and the pure re-claim decision live in
 * `src/lib/firestore/schedulerMarkers.ts` (and are re-exported here so a job
 * handler needs one import); this module is the thin Firestore layer over
 * them. Read that module's header first: it explains WHY a claimed-but-
 * unsent marker has to be reclaimable, which is the only interesting thing
 * about this file.
 *
 * THE ORDER MATTERS AND IS NOT NEGOTIABLE:
 *
 *   1. `claim()`, which `.create()`s the marker. ALREADY_EXISTS means somebody
 *      else has this unit of work; stop.
 *   2. do the side effect (send the mail, mint the task)
 *   3. `stampSent()`, which writes `sentAt`.
 *
 * Claim first, send second. The reverse order (send, then mark) turns any
 * crash into a duplicate send, and duplicates are the failure mode people
 * complain about publicly. This order turns a crash into a MISSED send
 * instead, which is why step 3 has a recovery rule and step 1 does not.
