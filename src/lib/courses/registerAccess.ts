/**
 * WHO MAY TOUCH A GROUP'S REGISTER, in one place.
 *
 * There are now four doors onto the same documents: the register itself
 * (GET and POST), the admin's post-push edit (PATCH), PUSH ATTENDANCE, and the
 * participant-note drawer. They are four verbs on ONE act, running a session,
 * so one predicate decides who may use any of them, and it lives here.
 *
 * ── THE PREDICATE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A facilitator of THIS group, while it is LIVE (`courseGroups.facilitatorUids`
 * on a group that is not archived) union admins. That is the whole list.
 *  · ARCHIVING A GROUP UNSTAFFS IT. One rule, stated identically in
 *    `runAccess.ts`, the exercises queue, the review route and the page gates.
 *    Admins bypass it: an archived cohort is exactly what an admin is asked to
 *    go back and look at.
 *  · Plain members get 403. Attendance is a roster-wide record, and "who else
 *    missed last week" is not a member's to read even about their own group. A
 *    member's OWN attendance travels on the run overview instead.
 *  · Another group's facilitator, an admissions reviewer and a track lead all
 *    get 403. Admissions is a SEPARATE LANE from the cohort, and staffing a
 *    run is not facilitating a group, which is why the run doc is not
 *    consulted for access at all.
 *
 * ── AUTHORIZATION BEFORE EXISTENCE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * A missing group, an ARCHIVED group and a group you do not facilitate all
 * collapse onto the SAME 403, so probing group ids tells you nothing about
 * which ones exist. The honest 404/400 answers below the gate are reachable
 * only by an admin, who could read those documents anyway.
 *
 * ── PII: NAMES ONLY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `displayNameOf` never returns an email. A register is a list of people who
 * did or did not turn up; it must not double as a mailing list. Anything that
 * needs to reach these people goes through the group email route, which
 * resolves addresses server-side and never hands them out.

 * they were before an admin's correction, which is the one moment the numbers
 * were known to be wrong. Nothing is excluded, so there is nothing to name.
 *

 * (runId, groupId, status) composite index the roster and the register query
