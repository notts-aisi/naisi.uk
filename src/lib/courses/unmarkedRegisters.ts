/**
 * THE UNMARKED-REGISTER FOLLOW-UP, everything about it that is arithmetic.
 *
 * A facilitator who never presses PUSH ATTENDANCE costs their group two
 * things at once: the register (so every member of the group carries a
 * session in a denominator reviewers read as a shortfall) and the next
 * week's reminder email, which the push is what sends. Neither failure
 * announces itself. This module is the maths behind the job that does.
 *
 * PURE. No Firestore, no clock unless one is passed, no runtime imports at
 * all beyond types and one string constant, so the unit suite can transpile
 * it standalone on the repo's Node 20 (tests/unmarked-registers.test.mjs).
 * The Firestore half is `src/lib/scheduler/jobs/unmarkedRegisters.ts`.
 *
 * ── THE WINDOW IS A BAND, NOT A THRESHOLD ───────────────────────────────────
 * The scan looks only at sessions whose END instant is between the grace
 * (`config/courses.unmarkedRegisterGraceHours`, default 36) and the grace plus
 * 24 hours. A threshold ("older than the grace") would re-derive every unmarked
 * session of the whole term on every tick, which is exactly the read cost the
 * 60s ceiling cannot absorb; the marker would suppress the WRITES, and the
 * reads would still happen. A 24-hour band over a tick every 15 minutes gives
 * each session roughly ninety-six chances to be seen, which is enough slack for
 * a scheduler that has been down for most of a day.
 *
 * The band's cost, stated plainly: a register still unpushed a week later has
 * one task on the board and gets no second one. That is the right shape (a
 * follow-up you cannot get rid of is nagging, not a follow-up) but it does mean
 * the board is the only record, so the task must not be silently archived by
 * anything other than the push.
 *
 * ── "UNMARKED" MEANS "NOT PUSHED" ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three tests were available: no register document, a register with no marks,
 * or a register with `pushedAt` null. The job uses NOT PUSHED, which subsumes
 * the first two, because the push is the thing the task asks for. A register
 * half-marked and left open has had none of the effects a pushed one has: the
 * mirrors are not rebuilt, the group's reminder has not gone, and an admin
 * reading the attendance sees nothing. Asking for marks rather than for the
 * push would close the task on a register that still owes the group its email.
 *
 * `held: false` is the exception and it is not a special case: a session the
 * facilitator has said did not happen is one nobody has to chase, and the
 * switch is exactly the statement the register is complete.

 *  - completers are the ADMINS. `permissions` and roles both move; "every
 *    admin" is the one audience that is always somebody, and the owner
 *    decision is explicit that unmarked registers land on the admins' board.
 *  - `reviewerUids: []`. The contract's prose asks for the admins as reviewers
 *    too; the rules cap `reviewerUids` at 5 while `completerUids` is capped at
 *    10, so on a committee of six admins a reviewer-mirrored task falls
 *    outside the band every non-admin update path checks. A chase needs no
 *    signoff ritual either: it is done when the register is pushed, and the
 *    push archives it.
 *  - `initialNotifyAt: now`, born already notified, so the task-email
 *    machinery never mails about it. The follow-up is a board card; a job that
 *    emailed every admin per unmarked group per week would be muted inside a
 *    fortnight.
 *  - `sourceRef` carries the group and the session ALONGSIDE the (cohortId,
 *    weekNumber) pair every other consumer reads, so the destroy sweep and the
 *    push's archive can both find this card by data rather than by parsing an
 *    id. Absent rather than null on a mirror, per the pinned-map rule.
