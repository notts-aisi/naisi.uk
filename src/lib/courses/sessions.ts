/**
 * THE TAUGHT SESSIONS OF ONE GROUP, in order, with the OCCURRENCE dimension.
 *
 * Until this module existed, "a session" and "a taught week" were the same
 * thing everywhere in the codebase: the register was keyed by (run, group,
 * week), `sessionOverrides` and `sessionModes` were keyed by week id, and a
 * group that met twice in a week had no way to say so. PR5 shipped the DATA
 * seam for the second meeting and deliberately stopped there, because the
 * key shape is a birth-pinned decision and the cadence question behind it was
 * an owner's to answer, not a coder's.
 *
 * This module is the RESOLVER half of that seam. It answers one question:
 * which sessions does this group actually hold, and what is each one called.
 * Every consumer that used to derive it by hand (the register's columns,
 * the push, the week lock, the unmarked-register scan) asks it here instead.
 *
 * ── THE ONE INVARIANT THAT MAKES THIS SHIP WITHOUT A MIGRATION ──────────────
 * `sessionKey(n, 1) === weekDocId(n)`, byte for byte. Register ids are
 * `{runId}__{groupId}__{sessionKey}` (see `attendanceDocId`), so every
 * register already written keeps its id, `accountDeletion`'s `documentId()`
 * scan keeps working, and nothing anywhere has to move. Occurrence 2 and up
 * get a `-2`, `-3` suffix, which is a doc id no week has ever produced.
 *
 * A HYPHEN, and not `#` or `.`: the key is spliced into Firestore document
 * ids (registers, scheduler markers, the unmarked-register task) and into URL
 * query values, and a hyphen needs no escaping in either. `__` is already the
 * house id separator and is deliberately not reused inside one component.
 *
 * ── THE SECOND SLOT IS READ, NOT ASSUMED ────────────────────────────────────
 * A group's second weekly slot lives on `courseGroups.extraSession`, which
 * `normalizeCourseGroup` does NOT yet produce: that field is still blocked on
 * the pre-course cadence decision, and adding it is a rules change this PR
 * does not carry. So `resolveSessions` reads it OPTIONALLY. Today every
 * caller passes a normalised group, every group resolves to exactly one
 * session per taught week, and every register id is unchanged. The moment the
 * field lands, this module already knows what to do with it, and its tests
 * already say what that is.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT RESOLVED FOR OCCURRENCE 2 ──────────────────────
 * `sessionOverrides` and `sessionModes` are `Record<weekId, ...>` with no
 * occurrence component, and `sessionModes` is pinned FLAT in firestore.rules
 * precisely to keep that pin one comparison. So a per-week room move or
 * virtual switch applies to the week's FIRST session only, and the second
 * carries the group's standing `extraSession` unmodified. That is a stated
 * limitation of the current key shape rather than a resolution rule: when the
 * maps are re-keyed, this function is where the second lookup goes.
 *
 * ── PURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No reads, no clock unless one is passed. `resolveCalendar` is the same
 * group-first resolution every schedule consumer uses, so a group pacing
 * itself apart from its run resolves its OWN dates here, exactly as its
 * members see them.

 * than its first, so "the first unfinished element" would name next Thursday
 * while tonight's Tuesday session went unannounced.
 *
 * `sessionInstants` answers "cannot say" with nulls on a session it cannot
 * date, and those are SKIPPED rather than read as past or future. Guessing
 * either way would either hide a session that is about to happen or announce
 * one that already has.
 *
 * Dates compare as CIVIL DATE KEYS, which sort correctly as plain strings, so
 * the ends of the range are read off without parsing anything. A group with no
 * usable start date has no range at all, which is a real state rather than a
 * failure: the register still has its columns, and the card simply says less.
