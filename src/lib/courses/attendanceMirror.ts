/**
 * THE ENROLMENT MIRROR: rebuilding `courseEnrolments.attendance` from the
 * registers, inside the transaction that changed one of them.
 *
 * TWO CALLERS, ONE ARITHMETIC. The push stamps a register as pushed; the
 * admin's post-push edit changes marks on one that already is. Both then have
 * to leave every affected member's rollup correct, and a second
 * implementation of "correct" is how two numbers that must agree stop
 * agreeing. So both express their change as an OVERRIDE laid over what the
 * transaction read, and take the same recompute.
 *
 * ── ALL READS BEFORE ANY WRITE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A Firestore transaction refuses a read after a write, so this is split in
 * two: `readMirrorPlan` does every read the recompute needs and returns the
 * writes; the caller applies them. That is also why the override exists at
 * all, rather than the caller writing first and this re-reading: the register
 * being changed cannot be read back inside the same transaction.
 *
 * ── THE FULL SET OF REGISTERS, ADDRESSED ────────────────────────────────────
 * Every session the group holds has a deterministic register id, so the read
 * is one `getAll` over ids built from `resolveSessions` rather than a query.
 * No index, no ordering surprise, and a session with no register yet simply
 * comes back missing, which is the same thing as a session nobody has marked.
 *
 * ── SCOPE: EVERY ENROLMENT ON THE GROUP, NOT EVERY ACTIVE ONE ───────────────
 * The `members` this is handed come from `loadMirrorMembers`, which reads all
 * four enrolment statuses. A rollup is read on surfaces a withdrawn or removed
 * member still appears on (the admin's enrolment view, their own run
 * overview), so recomputing only the active ones would freeze everybody else's
 * figures at their pre-correction values the moment an admin fixes a register.
 * The REGISTER's rows are a different list, the active members, because they
 * are who a facilitator can mark.
