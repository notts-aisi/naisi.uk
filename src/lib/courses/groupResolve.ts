/**
 * GROUP-FIRST RESOLUTION — the one shared helper for per-group autonomy
 * (v2 decision 4, refined to COPY-ON-WRITE).
 *
 * A group tracks its run's canonical curriculum and calendar until its
 * facilitator personalises them. From that moment:
 *
 *  - a member's WEEK CONTENT = their group's forked week
 *    (`courseGroups/{groupId}/weeks/{wNN}`) if it exists, else the run
 *    canonical (`courseRuns/{runId}/weeks/{wNN}`);
 *  - a member's CALENDAR = their group's `paceStartDate`/`paceWeekPlan`
 *    overrides if set (`null` = track the run), else the run's.
 *
 * THE DESIGN RULE: every schedule/content consumer resolves through THIS
 * module. Nothing resolves group content ad hoc — a consumer that re-derives
 * "which week doc does this member see" or "when does this member's week
 * roll" by hand is a bug even when its answer happens to agree today.
 *
 * Public + pre-allocation surfaces stay run-canonical by construction: they
 * pass `group = null` (an unallocated member HAS no group), and the fall-
 * through below is the run.
 *
 * ## Isomorphic, like `weekPlan.ts`
 *
 * The calendar half is pure and shared by client components, server
 * components and route handlers. The `resolveWeek*` helpers need a
 * `Firestore` handle and are server-only in practice — the firebase-admin
 * import is TYPE-ONLY so this module never drags the Admin SDK into a client
 *  bundle.
 *
 * ## Malformed input
 *
 * `memberCurrentWeek` inherits `currentWeekFor`'s contract: it throws
 * `RangeError` on a start date that is not a real civil date. A group's
 * `paceStartDate` cannot be the thrower — `normalizeCourseGroup` nulls
 * anything `isValidDateKey` rejects, degrading to run-tracking — so the guard
 * consumers already hold (`isValidDateKey(run.startDate)`) remains the only
 * one needed.

 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS AS A UNIT ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `resolveCalendar` and `memberCurrentWeek` were always meant to be read as a
 * pair, and every caller that read one and not the other has been a bug. The
 * run overview resolved ONE calendar for the caller and then drew a card per
 * group off it, so a facilitator holding a Monday group on the run's pacing and
 * a Thursday group three weeks behind was shown the same week number, the same
 * slot start and the same session override on both cards. Two groups, one
 * calendar, and no way to tell from the page which one was lying.
 *
 * So the unit of resolution is A GROUP, not a caller. Hand this function each
 * group in turn and every card is answered on its own clock.
 *
 * `currentWeek` is null on an unusable start date rather than throwing: a
 * half-authored run is a legitimate state (see the module header), and the
 * `RangeError` contract belongs to `currentWeekFor`, not to a summary a page
 * renders. A caller that must ALSO suppress the week for another reason (a
 * draft run, say) nulls it downstream; this function knows only about dates.

 * the weeks they are about to attend, come back "hadn't joined the group in
 * week 3", the grid renders those cells inert, and `ProgressBody` leaves them
 * out of the member's own total.
 *
 * `group === null` (unplaced) resolves the run canonical, which is exactly
 * what an ungrouped member is paced by.
 *
 * SHARED, not copied: both writers of a fresh enrolment call this one
 * function. The allocation route stamps it for an accepted applicant; the

 * copies of this arithmetic is how the two writers end up disagreeing about

 *    deserves the note even in the rare case the fork is still

 *  - `pace`: overrides compare as OVERRIDES, not as resolved calendars: a

 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `groupsDiverge` + A TEMPLATE ───────────────────────
 * `groupsDiverge` is SYMMETRIC by design: it answers "does this move cross a
 * boundary", not "which side is the unusual one". The board's first note
 * attributed every crossing to the TARGET unconditionally — so moving someone
 * OUT of a forked, re-paced group and back into the unallocated pool read
 * "Unallocated runs on its own schedule and has its own version of some weeks,
 * unlike Group B", which is three falsehoods in one sentence about a column
 * that is definitionally the run canonical.
 *
 * So divergence is computed PER SIDE — each end against the run canonical —
 * and the copy is chosen by direction:
 *
 *  · the TARGET diverges  → what they are moving INTO is unusual;
 *  · only the SOURCE does → what they are LEAVING was, and the destination is
 *    the course's own;
 *  · both                 → both clauses, in that order.
 *
 * THE SYMMETRIC PREDICATE IS STILL THE GATE. A lane is only ever WORDED when
 * `groupsDiverge(from, to)` flags it, so two groups holding the identical pace
 * override still produce no pacing sentence: nothing about the mover's
 * schedule changes, whatever either group does relative to the run. And
 * because a flagged lane means the two ends differ in it, at least one side
 * always diverges in that lane — the note can never end up with both clauses
 * empty after the gate has opened.
