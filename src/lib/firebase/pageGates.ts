/**
 * The admissions console, `/admin/admissions`. Its own tree and its own gate,

 * be wrong in both directions here.
 *
 * Two audiences reach this tree, and they are not the same set:
 *
 *  - AUTHORS: an admin, or a member holding `approveCourse`
 *    (`canAuthorAdmissionRound`). They write the round.
 *  - REVIEWERS: anyone the roles route has appointed on some round, carried on
 *    `users.admissionsReviewer`. They write nothing here. They are admitted so
 *    the Admissions entry in the sidebar goes somewhere rather than bouncing
 *    them to `/dashboard`, which is the dead-link failure the denormalised
 *    flag exists to avoid. The round page renders them a read-only summary,
 *    and every route under `/api/admissions` re-checks the round's own
 *    `reviewerUids` regardless of what this gate let through.
 *
 * `admissionsReviewer` is a DENORMALISATION and nothing clears it when the
 * person stops being eligible, so the flag is paired with the live bar the
 * round routes apply. Without the pairing a demoted reviewer would be walked
 * into a console every route beneath it would refuse, which reads as a broken
 * page rather than as a revoked appointment.
 *
 * The gate is a page-level convenience, never the boundary: the boundary is
 * each route, and `admissionRounds` is `allow read, write: if false` so
 * nothing here can be reached client-direct.
