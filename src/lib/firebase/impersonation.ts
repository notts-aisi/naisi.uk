 * Refuse a high-trust write while an admin is in a view-as session.

 * View-as is a full impersonation: the `__session` cookie holds the TARGET's
 * session, so `getCurrentUser()` returns the target and Firestore records
 * every write as the target performing it. That is exactly what makes the tool
 * useful for reproducing "the Events tab isn't showing for me", and exactly
 * what makes it unsafe for anything that decides, allocates, publishes,
 * removes, marks attendance, reviews work, sends email, changes status or
 * destroys: such a write would be recorded as the member's own.
 *
 * Usage, at the very top of the handler, before any other work:
 *
 *   const blocked = await assertNotImpersonating();
 *   if (blocked) return blocked;
 *
 * Returns `null` when there is no view-as session, so the caller carries on.
 * A STALE marker (`actorUid` equal to the current session's uid, so the admin
 * is signed in as themselves again) is not a session: it is cleared here, the
 * same self-heal `POST /api/admin/impersonate` does, and the write proceeds.
 * Refusing on it would leave an admin locked out of their own high-trust
 * routes until they thought to clear a cookie they cannot see.
 *
 * What this covers:
 *
 *  - Every mutating route handler under the trees listed in
 *    `tests/impersonation-guard.test.mjs`, which is where the writes that
 *    decide, allocate, publish, remove, mark attendance, review work, send
 *    email, change status or destroy actually live.
 *  - The whole `/admin` page tree, which `(app)/admin/layout.tsx` closes
 *    during a view-as session because the course editors under it write to
 *    Firestore client-direct, with no route handler in the path for this
 *    guard to sit in.
 *
 * A surface that writes client-direct answers to `firestore.rules` alone, and
 * rules see the target, because view-as swaps the session. A new surface of
 * that kind needs its page tree closed during a view-as session, or its write
 * routed through a handler that calls this guard.
