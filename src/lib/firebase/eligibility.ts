/**
 * BEING NAMED IS NOT A STANDING GRANT.
 *
 * A dozen documents in this database carry an array of uids that decides what
 * the people in it may do: a run's `trackLeadUids`, a round's `reviewerUids`,
 * a circulation's `staffUids`, a worksheet's `authorUid`. Every one of those
 * arrays is written behind a bar — the run roles route intersects with the
 * approved accounts, the round roles route runs `isEligibleAdmissionsReviewer`
 * against each candidate's live user document, a worksheet can only be created
 * by a committee member. This module asks the same bar again when the
 * authority is USED, so a person who no longer meets the bar their appointment
 * required is refused by the gates that read these arrays.
 *
 * The check sits at the point of USE, where the live session already is:
 * `getCurrentUser` re-reads the live role on every request, so the role in
 * hand is always correct. `firestore.rules` applies the same rule in its own
 * dialect: the role test sits inside `isAuthor()` rather than beside its
 * callers.
 *
 * ── HOW TO USE IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A gate that would otherwise read
 *
 *     const isTrackLead = run.trackLeadUids.includes(actor.uid);
 *
 * reads
 *
 *     const isTrackLead = isNamedWithStanding(
 *       actor, "courseRuns.trackLeadUids", run.trackLeadUids,
 *     );
 *
 * and the admin branch stays where it was. Admins are deliberately NOT folded
 * in here: they are resource-independent (`isAdmin()` in the rules matches the
 * whole collection whatever the document says), every gate already writes that
 * branch, and hiding it inside a predicate named for an array would make an
 * admin look like a track lead in a stack trace.
 *
 * `tests/authority-at-use.test.mjs` walks the tree for the raw comparison and
 * fails on one that is not registered as something other than a gate, so a new
 * route that reads an authority array against its caller's own uid is covered
 * without anybody remembering that this module exists.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is not per-document authorisation: it answers "does this person still
 * meet the bar their appointment required", not "are they on this document".
 * Both halves are needed and `isNamedWithStanding` is the one that takes both,
 * which is why it is the function the gates call and `holdsStanding` is
 * exported mostly for the guard to execute.
 *
 * It is not a replacement for `firestore.rules`, and it is not a substitute
 * for one either. Every array below is pinned against client WRITES, but the
 * READ side is a separate question. A route that refuses a rejected account is
 * worth nothing if the browser can read the same document directly, so the
 * rules apply `isApprovedAccount()` inside `isCompleter()`, `isReviewer()`,
 * `isStaff()`, `isParentStaff()`, `isCollaborator()`, `isOwnEvent()`,
 * `isCourseCollaborator()`, `isOwnCourse()` and `hasPerm()`. This module is
 * the half for the routes that use the Admin SDK and therefore see no rules at
 * all; the two halves have to be read together.
 *
 * It does not clear stale membership. A demoted person stays listed in the
 * array they were appointed to, and a surface that renders the list will still
 * show their name. Removing them is an admin's act on the run or the round;
 * refusing them is this module's, and refusing is the half that has to be
 * right when nobody remembers to tidy up.
