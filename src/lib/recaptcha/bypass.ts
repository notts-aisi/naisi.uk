/**
 * A scoped way through the reCAPTCHA gate for the end-to-end harness, and
 * nowhere else.
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * The real reCAPTCHA widget answers headless Chromium with an image
 * challenge, which no test may solve: the gate being closed to automation is
 * the property `scripts/e2e/tests/recaptcha-gate.test.mjs` asserts. So the
 * browser specs need a way through that a human can never trip.
 *
 * ## Three conditions, all required, and only for a TOKENLESS request
 *
 *  1. `E2E_RECAPTCHA_BYPASS_SECRET` is set in this process's environment. It
 *     must never appear in `apphosting.yaml`, which every backend reads, and
 *     `tests/recaptcha-bypass.test.mjs` fails the build if it does. Without
 *     the variable this function returns false before reading anything else,
 *     so wherever it is not set the path does not exist.
 *  2. The request carries the header `x-e2e-recaptcha-bypass` equal to that
 *     value, compared in constant time.
 *  3. The acting identity is a harness identity: an address inside the
 *     namespace `e2e-<alnum>@e2e.invalid`, the same pattern every teardown
 *     helper under `scripts/e2e` trusts and refuses outside of. For the apply
 *     routes that is the signed-in account's email; for `/api/register` it is
 *     the address being registered. `.invalid` cannot receive mail, so an
 *     account that clears this check cannot belong to a person.
 *
 * And the gate consults this ONLY when the request carries no token. A token
 * that is present is always verified with Google, bypass header or not, so a
 * human keeps the real widget and a bypass secret alone changes nothing for
 * them. The harness sends no token when it holds the secret.
