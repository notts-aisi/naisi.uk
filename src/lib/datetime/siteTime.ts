/**
 * Dates and times as the site states them: London civil time, UK format.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `date.toLocaleString(undefined, …)` formats in the zone and the locale of
 * whatever process runs it. In a browser that is the reader. On the server it
 * is the container, and a Cloud Run container is UTC and en-US, so every event
 * time rendered by a Server Component or written into an email read one hour
 * early for the whole of British Summer Time, in American date order with
 * AM/PM (the public list printed "Thu, May 28 at 04:30 PM"). It was invisible
 * in development, because a laptop in Nottingham has the right defaults, and
 * it reached the public events list, the event page, the home page, the RSVP
 * emails, the change notices and the announcement.
 *
 * An event, a deadline or a publication date here is a statement about a room
 * in Nottingham, so it is formatted in one zone for every reader, the way the
 * courses tree already does with `COURSE_TZ`. Anything that runs on the server
 * and formats an instant goes through this module; `tests/server-date-formatting.test.mjs`
 * walks the tree for a formatter that does not name its zone.
 *
 * No `server-only` import: `tests/server-date-formatting.test.mjs` loads this
 * module in-process, and the answer is deliberately the same in a browser if a
 * client component ever reaches it.
