/**
 * The round status MACHINE: what may follow what, and which moves have to be
 * confirmed before they happen.
 *
 * ## One table, and where it lives
 *
 * The transition map itself is `ADMISSION_ROUND_TRANSITIONS` in
 * `src/lib/firestore/admissionRounds.ts`, beside the union it is written in
 * terms of. This module is the only thing that INTERPRETS it: the status
 * route calls `planStatusChange` and so does the console's status control, so
 * a button that offers a move and a route that refuses it cannot drift apart.
 * There is deliberately no second copy of the arrows anywhere.
 *
 * That is safe ONLY because `admissionRounds` is `allow write: if false`, so
 * one Admin SDK route is the sole writer. The moment a client-direct write is
 * allowed onto the round document, this table has to be duplicated into
 * `firestore.rules` in the same change.
 *
 * ## Why a plan object rather than a boolean
 *
 * Two of the moves are not simply legal or illegal:
 *
 *  - `closed -> open` REOPENS a form people have already been told is shut.
 *    It is the extend-the-deadline path and it is legitimate, but it is not a
 *    move anybody should make by tapping a dropdown, so it carries
 *    `requiresConfirmation` and the route refuses it without an explicit
 *    `confirm: true`.
 *  - moving to the SAME status is not an error at all. A double-tapped button
 *    or a retried request must not 400, and must not write an audit line
 *    claiming something changed, so it comes back as `noop`.
 *
 * A boolean would have collapsed both of those into "allowed", and the
 * refusal copy would then have been written twice, once in the route and once
 * in the console.
