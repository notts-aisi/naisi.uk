/**
 * The reads behind the applicant status hub, in one module so the two pages
 * and `GET /api/admissions/applications/me` cannot drift into three different
 * ideas of what a caller's applications are.
 *
 * ## Addressed by uid, never by anything a caller sends
 *
 * `admissionApplications` is `allow read, write: if false`, so this is an
 * Admin SDK read with no rule underneath it. The only filter that matters is
 * therefore written here: `where("uid", "==", uid)` with a uid taken from the
 * session, and, on the single-round path, the deterministic document id built
 * from that same uid. There is no code path in this module that reads an
 * application belonging to anybody else, and none may be added: the staff
 * surfaces have their own routes, with their own blinding.
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT filtered on window state
 *
 * This is the surface that has to survive the deadline. An applicant checking
 * on the Monday after applications closed is the most likely visitor it will
 * ever have, and a hub that hid their row the moment the window shut would be
 * useless exactly when it matters. Rounds that are no longer public objects at
 * all (a draft, or one that has been archived) still show their row, with no
 * link onward: the answers are still the applicant's own, and hiding somebody's
 * application because the team tidied up afterwards is a worse failure than an
 * unlinked card.
 *
 * ## Nothing in this module can address the private sibling collection
 *
 * The access-requirements answer lives in the private sibling of this
 * collection, and the privacy notice promises every read of it is recorded.
 * This surface records nothing, so it must be unable to read it, and "unable"
 * is meant structurally rather than as a habit: the collection name comes from
 * `@/lib/firestore/admissionApplications`, a leaf that knows a shape and an id
 * and holds no database handle, rather than from the apply tree's shared
 * context module, which exports the two helpers that address the private
 * sibling on a caller's behalf. The source pins in
 * `tests/admissions-status-hub.test.mjs` hold this module and the `/me` route
 * to it. Do not import that context module here for a constant: move the
 * constant instead.
 *
 * ## No `orderBy` on the query
 *
 * The house rule (sparse fields drop documents from an ordered query) plus a
 * second reason: ordering wants `updatedAt`, and the rows are joined to their
 * rounds in memory anyway. `sortStatusRows` is the one ordering, applied after
 * the join, so the API and both pages list them identically.
 */

/**
 * Cap on how many of one person's applications the hub will load. Well past
 * anything real (an autumn intake, a facilitator round, a spring intake is
 * three), and there purely so a corrupted or scripted account cannot turn one
 * page render into an unbounded read.
