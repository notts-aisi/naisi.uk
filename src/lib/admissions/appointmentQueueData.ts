/**
 * The reads behind the appointment queue, in one module so the page and any
 * later route cannot drift into two ideas of what the queue is.
 *
 * ## Nothing here can reach the private sibling collection
 *
 * The access-requirements answer lives in the private sibling of this
 * collection, and the privacy notice promises every read of it is recorded.
 * This surface records nothing, so it must be structurally unable to read it,
 * and "unable" is meant structurally rather than as a habit: the collection
 * name comes from `@/lib/firestore/admissionApplications`, a leaf that knows a
 * shape and an id and holds no database handle, rather than from the apply
 * tree's shared context module, which exports the two helpers that address the
 * private sibling on a caller's behalf. Do not import that module here for a
 * constant: move the constant instead. The same rule, and the same reason, as
 * `statusHubData.ts`.
 *
 * ## Admin SDK, and the gate is the caller's job
 *
 * `admissionApplications` and `admissionRounds` are both
 * `allow read, write: if false`, and the Admin SDK does not consult rules.
 * `canDecideAppointments` and `canViewAppointmentQueue` below are the
 * decision, and the page applies them before it calls the loader.

 * filters and `sortAppointmentRows` orders, once, after the join.

 * A DRAFT IS NOT AN APPLICATION and never appears here. Somebody halfway
