/**
 * Shared plumbing for the APPLICANT half of the rounds tree: what a round
 * looks like to somebody applying to it, which stages they may see the
 * questions of, and how their answers are read back off the wire.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate module from `roundRoutes.ts`
 *
 * `roundRoutes.ts` serves STAFF. Its `canSeeRound` admits authors, course
 * drafters, reviewers and the final decider, and its `serialiseRound` sends
 * the whole document, counters and `finalDeciderUid` included. None of that
 * may reach an applicant. Two audiences sharing one serialiser is how the
 * reviewer list ends up in a fresher's devtools: the shape is a spread, the
 * spread is invisible at the call site, and nothing fails.
 *
 * So the applicant projection is built FIELD BY FIELD below, and adding a
 * field to `AdmissionRoundDoc` does not silently add it to the applicant's
 * payload. `serialiseStage` is reused verbatim, because there the decision
 * that matters (may this caller see the questions) is already an explicit
 * argument.
 *
 * ## The release filter runs BEFORE serialisation, always
 *
 * `serialiseStageForApplicant` asks `isStageReleased` and RETURNS on the
 * unreleased branch. It does not build a serialised stage and then delete a
 * key: a stage that is not released is a different, smaller object which has
 * never had a `questions` key on it at any point in its construction. That is
 * the whole timed-release guarantee (see `stageRelease.ts`), and
 * `tests/admissions-apply-flow.test.mjs` pins the ordering against the source
 * of this function so a refactor cannot invert it.

 * account, where a real person has no reason to be near the limit.
 *
 * The AUTOSAVE limit is its own axis: the form saves every two minutes while
 * dirty, so ten minutes of continuous typing is five legitimate PATCHes before
 * a single explicit Save is pressed. A shared create/save budget would spend

 * come back on every autosave and every press of Save with nothing the

 * the key names no stage, so there is no question it could be an answer to and
 * no writer that could ever store it. `serialiseApplicationForOwner` prunes
 * the same keys on the way out, so a fresh load never carries one.
 *
 * `enforceRequired` is the draft/submit split: a draft is half written by
 * definition, so a blank required question is fine on the way in and refused
 * on the way out. Everything else (unknown options, over-limit answers,
 * malformed shapes) stays enforced on a draft, so a draft can never hold a
