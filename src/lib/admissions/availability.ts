/**
 * The availability grid: ONE codec, ONE shape.
 *
 * ## What this is
 *
 * An admission round asks "when could you actually be in a room in
 * Nottingham?" as a LettuceMeet-style grid: seven day columns (Sunday through
 * Saturday, so Saturday and Sunday are first-class rather than an
 * afterthought) cut into fixed slots between two wall-clock bounds. The
 * default grid is 09:00 to 21:00 in 15-minute slots, which is 48 slots a day
 * and 336 cells in total.
 *
 * A drawn grid is stored as SEVEN HEX STRINGS, one per weekday, four slots to
 * a character. At the default geometry that is nine characters a day and 63
 * characters for the whole answer, against 336 booleans or 336 array entries.
 * It fits in a document field nobody has to think about, and it survives a
 * JSON round trip unchanged.
 *
 * ## Why the geometry travels with the answer
 *
 * `AvailabilityMask` carries `startMinute`, `endMinute`, `slotMinutes` and
 * `version` alongside its `days`, duplicating what the round's
 * `availabilityGrid` already says. That duplication is the point. Widening a
 * round's window from 09:00-18:00 to 08:00-20:00 is meant to be a config
 * edit, not a schema migration; but the bit at index 0 of an answer drawn on
 * the old grid means 09:00, and the same bit read against the new grid means
 * 08:00. Without the stored geometry, one config edit silently shifts every
 * already-submitted answer an hour earlier, on the screen whose entire job is
 * putting people into session slots.
 *
 * So every read decodes against the geometry the answer was DRAWN on, and the
 * round's current grid is only ever the fallback for a row written before the
 * geometry was stored.
 *
 * ## Why there is no date arithmetic in this file
 *
 * Every number here is a WALL CLOCK: minutes past midnight in Europe/London
 * on an unspecified day, and a weekday index. No instant is ever constructed,
 * so no DST transition can move a slot, and the same drawn grid means the
 * same thing in October (BST) and in February (GMT). A session at 17:45 for
 * 30 minutes overruns an 18:00 grid whatever the date is. That is deliberate:
 * the applicant is answering "most Tuesdays", not "Tuesday 27 October".
 *
 * The conversion from a wall clock to a real instant belongs to
 * `londonWallClockToInstant` in `src/lib/courses/weekPlan.ts`, and it is the
 * caller's job, not this module's.
