/**
 * Shared plumbing for the `/api/admissions/rounds` tree: who may see a round,
 * and what a round looks like on the wire.
 *
 * ## Why serialisation lives here rather than in each route
 *
 * `admissionRounds` and its `stages` subcollection are both
 * `allow read, write: if false`, so EVERY staff surface reads them through
 * these routes. That makes the JSON shape the de facto public interface of the
 * collection, and a shape assembled independently in four handlers is a shape
 * that will disagree with itself: one route sending `closesAt` as an ISO
 * string and another as a Firestore timestamp object is a bug the console
 * discovers as an "Invalid Date" three weeks later.
 *
 * Dates go out as ISO strings. The client re-hydrates them once, in the round
 * client module, so no component ever parses a date itself.
 *
 * ## The `questions` rule, restated where it is easy to break
 *
 * Stage questions are the timed-release guarantee. They may be serialised for
 * an AUTHOR (they are authoring them) and never for anyone else on this tree.
 * `serialiseStage` therefore takes the decision as a required argument rather
 * than defaulting: a caller that forgets has to write `false` on purpose.
