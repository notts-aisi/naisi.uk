/**
 * READINESS: everything that has to be true before a round may open, checked
 * in one place and reported as a list rather than as a boolean.
 *
 * ## Why this is a shared predicate and not a form validation
 *
 * The round document is authored across eight sections and opened from a
 * ninth. Nothing in the editor forces an order, and nothing should: an admin
 * drafts the window in September, adds criteria in October and appoints
 * reviewers the week before review. So "is this round finished" cannot be a
 * property of any one section's save, and a form that refused an incomplete
 * save would make drafting impossible.
 *
 * What it CAN be is a property checked at the boundary, and there is exactly
 * one boundary: the move from `draft` to `open`. After that a real applicant
 * can reach the form. A round opened without questions shows an empty form; a
 * round opened without a `closesAt` never closes and no deadline reminder can
 * be derived from it; a round opened without a final decider reaches decision
 * week with nobody able to press the button.
 *
 * Both the panel and the status route call this, so what the panel says is
 * missing IS what the route refuses on. A second opinion in either place
 * would be a screen that says green next to a button that says no.
 *
 * ## Why the checks carry a section id
 *
 * "Not ready" is useless on a page this long. Every check names the editor
 * section that fixes it, so the panel can render a link straight to it, which
 * is the difference between a blocker and a to-do list.
