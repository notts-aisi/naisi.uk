/**
 * DESTROY an admission round: the irreversible end of an intake.
 *
 * A round can be CANCELLED, and cancelling is the everyday way to call one
 * off. It is a status, it keeps every application and every review readable
 * as history, and it is what an intake that did not happen should get.
 * Destroy is for the other cases: a round created by mistake, a test round on
 * dev, and data somebody has decided must not be retained. It removes the
 * round, its stages, every application on it with the access-requirements row
 * beside it, and every review written about those applications.
 *
 * This module is the engine. The routes own WHO and WHETHER (admin only, a
 * byte-equal typed confirmation, the refusal sentences); everything below
 * owns WHAT and IN WHAT ORDER, and it is written to the shape
 * `courseDeletion.ts` established for course runs, because a second dialect
 * of "how a destroy behaves" would be a second set of crash properties for
 * anybody to reason about. Same audit-row-first rule, same budgeted
 * delete-as-you-read pages, same resume-by-repeating-the-call contract, same
 * drained-guard throw.
 *
 * ## THE MEMBER RECORD IS WRITTEN FIRST, AND A FAILURE THERE REFUSES
 *
 * The rule this whole feature was built around: a destroy never deletes what
 * the committee wants to remember about a PERSON. Before a single document is
 * deleted, `writeRecordsForRound` makes sure each applicant has a record at
 * `memberRecords/{uid}/applications/{roundId}`: when they applied, what for,
 * the outcome, the score summary and the reviewers' notes as plain text. If
 * any one of those writes fails the cascade REFUSES and nothing is deleted
 * (`MemberRecordWriteError` → 409), because the alternative is a destroy that
 * quietly forgets one person.
 *
 * It writes the entries that are MISSING and leaves the ones that are already
 * there untouched. That is not an optimisation: rewriting a settled entry
 * would rebuild its reviewer notes from the reviews that survive today, and a
 * reviewer who has since deleted their account has had their reviews deleted
 * with it, so the rewrite would drop an assessment the settle had safely
 * preserved. `memberRecordSync.ts` argues that at length; the important
 * consequence here is that a destroy of a settled round normally writes
 * nothing and that is the healthy case, not a sweep that failed to run.
 *
 * It runs once per destroy rather than once per pass. The audit row carries
 * `recordsWrittenAt` as proof that the sweep finished, and a resume that
 * finds it skips the sweep: every application on the round is recorded before
 * anything is deleted, so the applications a resume still finds are a subset
 * of ones already recorded. A pass that died part-way through the sweep never
 * stamps it, so the resume runs it again.
 *
 * ## THE ROUND IS MARKED BEFORE THE FIRST DELETE
 *
 * Once the records are safe and before anything is removed, the round document
 * gets `destroying: true` and the audit id. A destroy runs in pages, so a big
 * round can be half gone between passes, and without the marker that half-gone
 * round is indistinguishable from a live closed one: the status route would
 * take `closed -> open` on it, `roundReadiness` would pass (the stages drain
 * last, so they are still there), and real applicants would file applications
 * into a round whose next resume deletes them. The status route refuses every
 * transition on a marked round, and the marker goes when the round document
 * does.
 *
 * ## What is NOT touched
 *
 * - `courseRuns` and the seat rows on them. A round feeds runs; the runs
 *   outlive it, and a member sitting on a cohort keeps their place when the
 *   intake that put them there is destroyed. The run destroy is the other
 *   direction of that relationship and it releases seats rather than deleting
 *   applications, for the mirror-image reason.
 * - `emailSends`. The append-only delivery log is evidence about messages
 *   that reached people's inboxes and outlives the round they mention. It is
 *   COUNTED on the manifest and never deleted.
 * - `dataExports`. The append-only record of which spreadsheets were taken
 *   off the platform and by whom. Counted, never deleted, same reasoning.
 * - `memberRecords`. The point of the exercise.
 * - `schedulerMarkers`. The two families that name a round
 *   (`remind__{roundId}__…` and `stagerel__{roundId}__…`) are dedupe rows with
 *   no member content, and a round id is a slug with a RANDOM SUFFIX, so a
 *   marker left behind can never suppress a send on a LATER round the way a
 *   group-keyed marker can (which is why the run cascade does drain those).
 *   That argument is the whole reason they are left; expiry is not part of
 *   it. Only a SETTLED marker is given an `expiresAt` at all
 *   (`schedulerMarkers.ts`), so a marker left claimed but unsettled by a
 *   round that has gone may sit there for good. Harmless, by the
 *   random-suffix argument, and cheaper than a manifest line the dialog
 *   would have to explain.
 * - `courseAudit`. The decide route writes a line naming the appointee when
 *   somebody is made a facilitator out of a round, and that line survives.
 *   It is keyed to the RUN rather than the round, it is the run's operational
 *   history rather than the intake's, and the run outlives the round for the
 *   same reason the seats do. It is applicant-identifying text, so it is
 *   named here rather than left to be discovered; it is not on the manifest
 *   because the manifest's retained lines are the two append-only logs the
 *   round itself wrote.
 *
 * ## No email
 *
 * Nothing here sends anything. Applicants are not told a round was destroyed:
 * there is no honest message to send them, and telling somebody their
 * application has been deleted is a conversation a person should have, not a
 * template.

/**
 * The fields this engine writes onto its own audit row on top of what

 * goes into the row's `deleted` map:
 *
 *  - `recordsWrittenAt`, the proof that the member-record sweep finished;
 *  - `memberRecordEntriesWritten`, how many records this destroy wrote;
 *  - `memberRecordEntriesAlreadyPresent`, how many were already on file and
 *    were deliberately left alone;
 *  - `reviewerFlagsCleared`, how many people's Admissions nav flag was turned
 *    off.
 *
 * THE `deleted` MAP IS DELETIONS ONLY, and keeping these out of it is a
 * correctness rule rather than tidiness. `destroyAudit.ts` documents that map
 * as per-collection deletion counts and calls the row the only surviving
 * evidence of a destroy, and the dialog renders every key of it under "and the
 * records listed below no longer exist". Put "member record entries written" in
 * there and both the audit log and the receipt end up asserting that the thing
 * the destroy exists to preserve has been destroyed.
 *
 * They live here rather than in the shared module because they are properties
 * of THIS cascade rather than of an audit. The shared row records what a
 * destroy removed; whether the records were written first is the round
 * cascade's own precondition, and the circulation cascade beside it has no
 * equivalent.
 *
 * `set(..., { merge: true })` with a plain number rather than `increment`,
 * because the sweep runs at most once per destroy and a resume that re-runs it
 * (a pass that died inside the sweep, so the stamp was never written) has to
 * REPLACE the half-finished count rather than add to it.
 *
 * A resume that finds the stamp skips the sweep, which is what keeps
 * `memberRecordEntriesWritten` an exact count rather than a sum over
 * overlapping rewrites: the records are written for EVERY application on the
 * round before anything is deleted, so the applications a resume still finds
 * are a subset of ones already recorded. A pass that died inside the sweep
 * never wrote the stamp, so the resume runs the sweep again.
 *
 * The lease that keeps two passes off one row is the shared
 * `claimDestroyAuditPass` / `releaseDestroyAuditPass` pair, so every destroy
 * in the codebase contends the same way.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL RACE, stated rather than hidden: two admins pressing Destroy

/**
 * Destroy one admission round. Admin-only (enforced at the route), resumable
 * by repeating the identical call.
 *
 * ORDER OF OPERATIONS, each step with the reason it sits where it does:
 *
 *  0. Blockers, on a FRESH destroy only, then the audit row. Audit first is
 *     the crash-safety property: from that write onward an open row exists
 *     for anything that dies.
 *  1. THE MEMBER RECORDS, before a single delete, refusing the whole destroy
 *     if any of them failed. See the module comment.
 *  2. THE `destroying` MARKER on the round, after the records are safe and
 *     before the first delete, so a round that is half destroyed between
 *     passes cannot be reopened to applicants. Also see the module comment.
 *  3. Reviews. They are written ABOUT the applications, so they go first: a
 *     review whose application is gone names nothing, and the review rows are
 *     the only place a reviewer's notes live until step 1 has copied them.
 *  4. Applications, each with its access-requirements row in the SAME batch.
 *     See `drainApplications` for why the pairing is not negotiable.
 *  5. Stages, the round's question blocks. After the applications, because an
 *     answer is keyed by the stage it was given in and the stage text is what
 *     makes a surviving answer legible.
 *  6. The reviewer nav flags, while the round document still exists, so the
 *     "named on another round" predicate can exclude this one by id.
 *  7. The round document LAST, then the audit row's completion stamp. While
 *     the round exists a resumed cascade can still find everything by name;
 *     deleting it is the write that makes the destroy final.
 *
 * The drain loop runs FULL PASSES until a pass deletes nothing. Pass one does
 * the work and the mandatory zero-delete pass is the verification: nothing
 * client-side can write any of these collections (`admissionApplications`,
 * `admissionReviews` and the stages are all `allow read, write: if false`), so
 * a pass that finds them empty is a pass that found them permanently empty.
 *
 * THE ROUND MUST STILL EXIST. There is no finishing mode for a cascade whose
 * round document has already gone: the route reads the round first and answers
 * 404 without ever calling this, and a mode nothing can reach is a mode nothing
 * tests. The window it would have covered is between the round delete in step 7
 * and the completion stamp on the line after it, and what it leaves behind is an
 * audit row with no `completedAt` on a round id that no longer resolves. That
 * row is a cosmetic wart in the destroy log rather than a hazard: everything is
 * already deleted, round ids carry a random suffix so a later round cannot
 * inherit it, and no surface reads an open row for a round that is not there.
