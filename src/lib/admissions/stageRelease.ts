/**
 * The RELEASE BOUNDARY: when a stage's questions may be handed out, and when
 * the answers to them are due.
 *
 * ## Why this is a boundary and not a display rule
 *
 * The autumn round releases its questions weekly, on dates announced up
 * front. That is a promise about fairness, not a piece of chrome: an
 * applicant who can read week three's essay question in week one has a
 * fortnight of thinking time nobody else got.
 *
 * Stage questions are therefore never kept on a document that any signed-in
 * account can read. Stages live in
 * `admissionRounds/{roundId}/stages/{stageId}`, which is
 * `allow read, write: if false`, and the ONLY way a question reaches a
 * browser is a route that has called `isStageReleased` first.
 *
 * So this predicate is the whole guarantee, and a route that serves a
 * question must call it first.
 *
 * ## The three ways a stage becomes released
 *
 *  1. **With the round.** `releaseAt: null` means "this stage is the form",
 *     the single-stage case, which is how the autumn round runs if the
 *     multi-stage work is descoped. It releases the moment the round's window
 *     opens and not a second earlier.
 *  2. **On its scheduled date.** `releaseAt` is a CIVIL date in
 *     Europe/London, with `releaseTimeLocal` as the wall clock on that day,
 *     because "released on Monday" is what was announced and a stored instant
 *     would need re-deriving every time the clocks changed. The conversion
 *     goes through `londonWallClockToInstant`, which handles the fold and the
 *     gap explicitly.
 *  3. **By hand.** `manualReleasedAt` is stamped by
 *     `POST .../stages/[stageId]/release`. It can only ever bring a release
 *     FORWARD: an admin who needs the questions out early presses the button,
 *     and the scheduled date is then irrelevant. It cannot push one back,
 *     because a question already served cannot be unserved.
 *
 * All three are gated behind the round's own window first. A stage of a
 * `draft` round is never released, however its dates read, and neither is a
 * stage of a CANCELLED round: cancelling a round is a decision to stop
 * asking, and handing out a fresh question afterwards would contradict it.
 * (An applicant's own saved answers live on their application row, not on the
 * stage, so nothing they have already written disappears with this.)
 *
 * ## Boundary semantics
 *
 * Inclusive, like every other date bound in the admissions modules: at the
 * release instant itself the stage IS released.

/**
 * Whether ANSWERS to this stage may still be written.
 *
 * ## Why this predicate exists
 *
 * A stage deadline is a promise to every applicant at once: nobody gets more
 * thinking time than the date they were told allows. That is the same fairness
 * property the release boundary above exists to protect, at the other end of
 * the stage.
 *
 * A deadline a person is told about and that bounds their own write is
 * enforced by that write. `tests/deadlines-enforced.test.mjs` is the guard for
 * the class.
 *
 * ## Reading a closed stage is still allowed
 *
 * `isStageReleased` deliberately keeps saying yes after a deadline, so
 * reviewers can read the questions all through review week and an applicant
 * can look back at what they were asked. This predicate is the narrower one:
 * it answers only "may an answer be STORED", which is what the submit routes
 * and the draft save need to know.
 *
 * ## The ROUND's window is part of the answer, not a separate check
 *
 * Every write path calls `windowRefusal` before it gets here, so a round that
 * is not open already refuses. This predicate asks the same question anyway,
 * because it is also what the applicant's page is RENDERED against: a round an
 * admin closed early keeps a `closesAt` in the future, and a flag that said
 * "open for answers" about it would put a live form in front of somebody whose
 * every submission the server refuses. The flag and the gate have to be the
 * same sentence or they drift, which is the whole reason this module exists.
 *
 * ## Boundary semantics
 *
 * Inclusive at both ends, like every other bound in these modules: at the
 * release instant the stage is open, and at the close instant it still is. A
 * stage with no deadline of its own inherits the round's, and a round with no
 * deadline leaves it unbounded, which is a readiness-panel failure rather than
 * a state to render.
