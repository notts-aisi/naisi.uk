/**
 * The applicant's session gate, and the Admin SDK handle that comes with it.
 *
 * ## Why this is its own module and not part of `applyContext.ts`
 *
 * `applyContext.ts` is where the apply tree's document helpers live, and two of
 * them (`privateRef`, `loadOwnApplication`) reach
 * `admissionApplicationPrivate`, the collection holding the
 * access-requirements answer. The privacy policy promises that every read of
 * that answer is recorded, and `tests/privacy-policy.test.mjs` enforces the
 * promise by scanning route sources: a route that can reach that collection,
 * including by importing the module that can, has to either log the read or be
 * listed in the owner lane with a reason.
 *
 * That is the right scan. It also means the session gate cannot live in the
 * same module as the private join, or every route that merely needs to know
 * who is calling drags the private collection into its import graph and has to
 * be argued about. So the gate lives here, this module reaches nothing but the
 * session and the SDK handle, and `applyContext.ts` re-exports it so the
 * existing apply routes are untouched.
