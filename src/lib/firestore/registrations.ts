/**
 * Signup / registration tracking — the data model behind the admin orphan
 * tracker and the suspicious-signup flagger.
 *
 * Two server-only stores feed this (both Admin-SDK-written, client-locked in
 * firestore.rules — read by admins through server routes, like emailSends):
 *
 *   registrations/{uid}      One DURABLE doc per account created via the
 *                            email-only register route. Keyed by the Auth uid so
 *                            re-registering the same email updates the same row.
 *                            Powers the tracker, the orphan list, and burst
 *                            detection. (Accounts created before this collection
 *                            shipped, or via Google, have no row — the tracker is
 *                            forward-looking by design.)
 *
 *   signupMetrics/{YYYY-MM-DD}  One BOUNDED daily counter doc aggregating every
 *                            signup ATTEMPT outcome (incl. reCAPTCHA failures,
 *                            which create no account and so can't live on a
 *                            per-account row). Powers the reCAPTCHA-fail-rate
 *                            signal. Bounded at one doc/day so a bot flooding the
 *                            register route can't balloon Firestore — the exact
 *                            abuse the flagger exists to catch.
 *
 * This module is PURE (no firebase-admin import) so both the client admin UI and
 * the server routes can share the types and helpers. The Admin-SDK write helpers
 * live in the server-only sibling `registrationWrites.ts`.

 * through Google). `pendingProfile` is whatever is left, so the four always
 * add up to the total and a row whose stored word is stale lands where its
 * flags put it, with no backfill.
 *
 * The flag is a mirror, so `completed` can differ from the list, which looks
 * the documents up. It UNDER-counts a profile whose flip was lost. It
 * OVER-counts in one case: a profile deleted while its row was kept, which the
 * account cascade does when a deletion half fails (it keeps the row so the
 * admin can retry). The list shows such a row as it is, so a difference
