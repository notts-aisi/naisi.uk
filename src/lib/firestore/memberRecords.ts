/**
 * `memberRecords/{uid}` and `memberRecords/{uid}/applications/{roundId}`: what
 * the committee keeps about a person, kept where a destroy cannot reach it.
 *
 * ## The rule this collection exists to honour
 *
 * It outranks every other decision in the deletion work: **a destroy never
 * deletes what the committee wants to remember about a person.** Destroying an
 * admission round is meant to remove a test round or a mistake. It is not
 * meant to remove the fact that somebody applied, what they applied for, how
 * it went, and what the reviewers thought, because that history is what a
 * later application is graded with.
 *
 * So the record is written BEFORE the thing it summarises can die. A round
 * destroy writes any missing entry FIRST and refuses if that write fails
 * (`docs/worksheets.md`, Deletion), which is only a safeguard because the
 * entry lives somewhere the same cascade is not about to drain.
 *
 * ## Why it hangs off the PERSON and not off the round
 *
 * A round is destroyable and a person is not, so a record filed under the
 * round is a record with a scheduled end. That is the structural half. The
 * practical half is the question the record answers: "what do we already know
 * about this applicant", asked while somebody is reading their new
 * application. Under the person that is one addressed read of a small
 * subcollection. Under the round it is a scan of every round that has ever
 * run, filtered by uid, and it is a scan that gets slower every year and
 * silently shorter every time a round is destroyed.
 *
 * `memberRecords/{uid}` itself carries almost nothing (`uid`, `updatedAt`). It
 * exists so the subcollection has a parent that shows up in a console listing,
 * because a subcollection under a missing document is real data that no admin
 * browsing Firestore can see.
 *
 * ## Why ONLY routes write it
 *
 * `allow write: if false` for every client, admins included, and the entry is
 * written by the Admin SDK from the settle and destroy routes. Three reasons,
 * in order of how badly each would bite:
 *
 *  1. The entry is a SUMMARY OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S WRITING. It copies reviewer
 *     notes and scores out of `admissionReviews`, which is `allow read, write:
 *     if false` precisely so no client can enumerate who scored whom. A
 *     client-writable record would be a way to put words into a named
 *     reviewer's mouth about a named applicant, with the record itself as the
 *     only surviving evidence once the round is destroyed.
 *  2. It is derived data with one correct derivation. `buildApplicationRecord`
 *     below is that derivation, and the arithmetic in it (which reviewers
 *     count towards a mean, what an unscored review contributes) has to be the
 *     same arithmetic every time or two entries written months apart are not
 *     comparable, which is the whole point of keeping them.
 *  3. It outlives its sources, so nothing can check it afterwards. A row that
 *     cannot be re-derived has to be right when it is written.
 *
 * ## Why account deletion KEEPS it
 *
 * `deleteAccountCascade` sweeps a member's admissions data: the application,
 * its private part and the reviews all go, because each is keyed to the uid
 * alone and would otherwise be an unnameable ghost. This collection is
 * deliberately not on that list, on the same reasoning that retains
 * `dataExports`, `emailSends`, `impersonations` and `courseAudit`: it is the
 * COMMITTEE'S RECORD OF ITS OWN DECISIONS, not the member's content.
 *
 * The distinction is worth stating precisely, because the entry does contain
 * material about a named person:
 *
 *  - it holds what the committee decided and why (the outcome, the scores, the
 *    reviewers' notes), which is a record of the society's own conduct;
 *  - it does NOT hold the member's own writing. No essay answers, no
 *    availability grid, no access-requirements answer, no email address. Those
 *    are the applicant's content and they go with the account.
 *
 * A deletion summary counts the entries kept, so the policy can be reversed
 * knowingly rather than discovered later. If it ever is reversed, the entry is
 * the whole unit: delete `memberRecords/{uid}` and its subcollection, and take
 * the count out of the summary in the same change.
 *
 * ## Plain text, always
 *
 * `reviewerNotes[].notes` is copied out of a review as a string and is meant to
 * be rendered as a TEXT NODE by every reader. Nothing here is markdown, nothing
 * here is a block list, and nothing here should ever be handed to a renderer
 * that interprets its input. `reviewerName` is a display name and never an
 * email address (see `reviewerDisplayName`).
 *
 * ## What this shape leaves room for
 *
 * Participation notes, how a member has taken part since, are a later slice.
 * They belong as a sibling subcollection under the same parent document
 * (`memberRecords/{uid}/participation/{...}`) rather than as fields on an
 * application entry, because they are not about one round and they accrue on
 * their own schedule. `memberConductFlags` is the precedent for admin-authored
 * notes about a member, and the read tier here (admin and SU-recognised
 * committee) is deliberately WIDER than that one, which is admin-only: a
 * conduct flag carries an allegation and this carries a decision.
 *
 * ## Why a client MAY import this file, and what that costs
 *
 * There is no `import "server-only"` here and the import of
 * `firebase-admin/firestore` is TYPE-ONLY, so the pure half of this module
 * (the two collection names, the limits, `buildApplicationRecord` and
 * `normalizeApplicationRecord`) can be imported from a `"use client"` module.
 * That is deliberate, and the rules are what make it necessary: admins and
 * SU-recognised committee read this collection CLIENT-DIRECT, so a browser
 * surface has to turn stored documents into the shape above, and by the
 * one-derivation argument three paragraphs up there is exactly one correct way
 * to do that.
 *
 * THE CLIENT THAT IMPORTS IT is `src/features/admin/useMemberApplications.ts`,
 * the listener behind the application history on the admin Members page. It
 * takes `normalizeApplicationRecord` and the two collection names from here
 * rather than keeping a copy of either, and that is the point: a second reader
 * of one stored shape is the read-side of the same mistake the write posture
 * above exists to prevent. Two readers drift, and they drift where it shows,
 * because the surface that RENDERS an entry would then disagree with the surface
 * that wrote it about what a field means (a stored `reviewerName` carrying an
 * address, say) and the render is the one a person reads. Any future client
 * reader belongs on the function at the bottom of this file too.
 *
 * The cost of holding that door open is one odd line, `serverTimestamp` below,
 * which takes the sentinel off the caller's own Firestore class instead of
 * value-importing `FieldValue`. A type-only import is erased by TypeScript and
 * carries nothing into a bundle; a value import would drag `firebase-admin`
 * into the browser chunk that hook is bundled into, where it resolves `fs`,
 * `net` and `http2`. Next enforces that boundary only when it bundles, so the
 * failure would be a broken rollout rather than a `tsc` error, which is why THE
 * `type` KEYWORD ON THE FIRST LINE OF THIS FILE IS LOAD-BEARING and
 * `tests/client-server-boundary.test.mjs` guards it by name. Most modules in
 * this directory (`dataExports.ts`, `schedulerMarkers.ts`) value-import the SDK
 * happily, because no browser has any business reading what they hold.
 *
 * The alternative is the split: the pure half in a sibling module, the Admin
 * SDK write here behind `import "server-only"`. That is the right move the day
 * this file needs more of the Admin SDK than one sentinel, and
 * `buildApplicationRecord` and `normalizeApplicationRecord` lift out cleanly
 * when it comes. One sentinel is not enough reason to cut a shape in half.
