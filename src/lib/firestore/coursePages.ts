/**
 * `coursePages/{courseId}`: the AUTHORED public page for a course.
 *
 * The doc id IS the course id, so a course can never have two pages and no
 * uniqueness query is needed anywhere. There is no `status`: this object is
 * the shop window's copy, and the thing that decides whether the world sees it
 * is `courses.status === "published"`, which the publish route already gates
 * on `approveCourse`.
 *
 * ## ROUTES-ONLY, and why that is not paranoia
 *
 * The rules block is `allow read: if isAdmin() || canDraftCourse() ||
 * canApproveCourse(); allow write: if false`, and every write goes through
 * `PUT /api/courses/[courseId]/page`. Only `useCoursePage` reads it from a
 * client, and only from inside `/admin/courses`.
 *
 * Client-direct authoring with a route beside it (which is how `courses` and
 * `courseRuns` work) is not used here, for one specific reason: a `richText`
 * block's `html` is rendered through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (see
 * `features/events/BlockView.tsx`), and for THIS collection that render
 * happens on a LOGGED-OUT marketing page. `sanitizeBlocks` is a shape filter,
 * `raw.filter(isValidBlock)`, so the HTML itself is neutered by
 * `sanitizeCoursePageBlocks` below.
 *
 * Two write paths cannot enforce one sanitisation. One can. So the route is
 * the only writer, and `sanitizeCoursePageBlocks` below runs at BOTH ends:
 * the route sanitises what it stores, and `normalizeCoursePage` sanitises
 * again at read time (the `normalizeCourse` pattern in `courses.ts`), so a row
 * that reached the collection by any other means is still neutered before it
 * reaches a renderer.
 *
 * ## Deletion
 *
 * The page is COURSE-scoped, not member-scoped: it holds no uid, no member
 * text and no PII. It is therefore counted in the course destroy manifest and
 * deleted by `destroyCourseCascade` (see `courseDeletion.ts`), and it is
 * deliberately NOT part of the per-account deletion sweep in
 * `accountDeletion.ts`. There is nothing of a member's in here to erase, and
 * a sweep keyed on `updatedByUid` would delete a course's public page because
 * the person who last edited it closed their account.

/**
 * Neuter a rich-text block's HTML: an allowlist rewrite, not an escape.
 *
 * ## What this is
 *
 * It is DEFENCE IN DEPTH on the one surface in the courses feature that renders
 * stored HTML to a logged-out visitor. The primary defence is that this
 * collection is `allow write: if false` and only one route writes it. This
 * function is what makes a row that arrives some other way harmless anyway.
 *
 * It is written for TipTap's own output. The allowlist is tiny and closed,
 * everything outside it is either dropped or escaped rather than passed
 * through, and it is applied at both the write and the read end.
 *
 * ## Why the output is safe whatever the reader makes of the input
 *
 * Nothing from the input reaches the output as markup. Every tag in the
 * output is BUILT here, from a name on the allowlist and attributes on the
 * allowlist with their values escaped, and every stretch of text between tags
 * has its angle brackets escaped. So a disagreement between this reader and a
 * browser about where a malformed tag ends can change which words show up as
 * text; it cannot produce an element or an attribute that is not on the list.
 *
 * ## A tag that never closes
 *
 * When a tag opens and the input ends before its `>` (or inside a quoted value
 * that never closes), everything from that `<` onward is text. TipTap does not
 * produce such a thing, and the reader never goes back to try the same stretch
 * another way.

 *  - a week the source HAS, whose stored row already carries a blurb, is kept
 *    when `overwrite` is false. That is the documented default: an author
 *    writes for the visitor, a week summary is written for the cohort, and a
 *    regeneration must not silently swap one for the other.
 *  - a week the source DOES NOT HAVE is kept when `overwrite` is false
 *    whatever its blurb says, because the source has no opinion about it. The
 *    result is a UNION, not a replacement, and without it a regeneration from
 *    a five-week snapshot deletes the theme an author wrote for week 7.
 *
 * `overwrite: true` waives both and makes the source the whole list, which is
 * the only way to shrink it from the generator.
