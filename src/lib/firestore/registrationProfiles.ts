/**
 * Whether an account has a profile behind it: a `users/{uid}` document (a
 * member, whatever its role) or a `collaborators` document carrying its uid.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FACT THE SIGNUP TRACKER REPORTS AGAINST. A registration row
 * carries a `profileComplete` flag, and the flag is a mirror: the browser
 * writes the profile client-direct and then tells the server it has, in a
 * request that a closed tab or a dropped connection can lose. A mirror is fine
 * for counting and wrong for a claim an admin acts on, so the two places that
 * make the claim both come here and look:
 *
 *  - the admin list (`/api/admin/registrations`) asks for every row it is about
 *    to show, so "Completed" on the screen means a document was there when the
 *    page loaded;
 *  - the flip itself (`/api/register/profile-complete`) asks before it sets the
 *    flag, so the flag can trail the document and can never run ahead of it.
 *
 * Reads only, and only existence. The member lookup is masked to a field the
 * profile documents do not carry, so what comes back says a document is there
 * and holds nothing from it. (A masked read still reports `exists`; that was
 * checked against Firestore itself, because the emulator-free tests cannot
 * show it.)
