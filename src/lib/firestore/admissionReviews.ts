/**
 * `admissionReviews/{roundId}__{applicantUid}__{reviewerUid}`: one
 * reviewer's scored assessment of one applicant.
 *
 * ## The doc id is the "no duplicates" rule
 *
 * Deterministic and CONSTRUCT-ONLY: one row per reviewer per applicant, so a
 * second submit is an UPDATE and never a duplicate. Aggregates (mean, spread,
 * coverage) are computed from these rows at read time and are stored nowhere,
 * which is what makes a re-score correct without a recount step.
 *
 * `roundId` is in the id as well as in a field because the review queue and
 * the coverage filters both page by round; the fields are what the queries
 * read, and the id is never parsed back apart.
 *
 * ## Routes-only, read:false as well as write:false
 *
 * `allow read, write: if false`, and the read half is not defence in depth.
 * An own-row read would let any reviewer enumerate who scored whom and how,
 * which is exactly the correlation a name-blind process exists to prevent,
 * and a list of one applicant's rows reveals a disagreement the queue
 * deliberately shows only as a spread.
 *
 * The route is what enforces the three rules rules cannot:
 *
 *  - the SELF-REVIEW guard (`applicantUid === reviewerUid` is a 403, and the
 *    queue also filters the caller's own application out as a second layer);
 *  - membership of `round.reviewerUids`, which is a cross-document check;
 *  - `total`, which is RECOMPUTED server-side from `scores` and the round's
 *    scale, ignoring whatever the client sent. A stored total a client can
 *    write is a ranking a client can write.
 *
 * ## Reviewer notes are disclosable
 *
 * Everything written here is part of the applicant's record and can be
 * disclosed to them on request. The review queue says so, in those words,
 * above the notes field. That is a reason to write carefully, not a reason to
 * hide the field.
