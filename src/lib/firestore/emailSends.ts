  // Staff-authored course mail (P9). Split three ways on purpose: the
  // deliverability tab's whole job is to answer "what did we send and who
  // sent it", and these three have different blast radii. `course-facilitator`
  // is operational mail to one small group; `course-broadcast` is an
  // announcement to a whole run's cohort channel; `course-test` is a rehearsal
  // that reached only its own sender. Collapsing them would make a 200-person
  // broadcast indistinguishable from a test send in the log.
  | "course-facilitator"
  | "course-broadcast"
  // The weekly course nudge (P11). Its own kind rather than folded into
  // `course-broadcast` because the two answer different questions in the
  // deliverability tab: a broadcast is a human deciding to write to a cohort,
  // a nudge is the recurring template that fires once per cohort week and is
  // built to be cronned. "Did the week 5 nudge go out?" has to be answerable
  // without reading subject lines, and a cohort's steady drip of nudges must
  // not drown out the announcements in the same view.
  //
  // There is deliberately no `course-nudge-test`: a rehearsal reaches only its
  // own sender whichever lane it rehearses, so the nudge route logs test sends
  // as `course-test` like the rest of the staff course mail. This kind means
  // mail that actually reached a cohort.
  | "course-nudge"
  // The room notice (V2-3, decision 8) — "we've moved to B52", "we're on Zoom
  // tonight". Its own kind, and NOT folded into `course-facilitator`, because
  // it is the one course lane that BYPASSES the `courses` opt-out: decision 8's
  // audit trail is these rows, and "how much un-opt-out-able mail did this
  // group send" has to be answerable without reading subject lines. It is also
  // the only kind keyed by GROUP rather than by run — `referenceId` is the
  // group id, which is what its 10-a-day cap is counted against.
  | "course-notice"
  // The enrolment lifecycle's own mail: today the drop-out confirmation. Kept
  // apart from `course-application` because that kind means the ADMISSIONS
  // funnel (applied, decided, placed) and this one means somebody joining or
  // leaving a run with no application behind it at all. "Did the person who
  // left get their confirmation" is a question the deliverability tab has to
  // answer without reading subject lines.
  | "course-enrolment"
  // The ADMISSIONS lifecycle (V3): everything NAISI sends somebody about their
  // application to a round. Kept apart from `course-application`, which means
  // the V2 per-run funnel this replaces, because the deliverability tab has to
  // answer "did the whole intake get its receipts" during the week an intake is
  // live, and mixing the two would make a round's mail unreadable next to the
  // legacy rows. Its `referenceId` is the ROUND id, not a run id: one round
  // feeds several runs and an appointment round feeds none.
  | "admissions"
  // The NOTICE LANE (the notification grid's third class). A person
  // responsible for an audience addressing that audience about something they
  // signed up for: an event's organiser, a group's facilitator, a run's staff.
  // It goes out whatever the recipient's notification grid says, so the
  // deliverability tab has to be able to answer "how much un-switch-off-able
  // mail did we send, and from which surface" without reading subject lines.
  // That second half is the `surface` field below, which only this kind
  // carries. `course-notice` is its ancestor and stays where it is: the room
  // notice's own audit trail (decision 8) is keyed by group and counted by a
  // per-group cap, and rewriting a year of rows to a new kind would break the
  // question it was built to answer.
  | "notice"
  // The "we have published a new event" announcement, sent once per event to
  // the `events` row of the grid. Its own kind rather than `newsletter`
  // because the two are different lists with different unsubscribe tokens,
  // and "did the announcement go out for this event" has to be answerable
  // next to a newsletter that went out the same afternoon. Its `referenceId`
  // is the EVENT id.
