/**
 * `courseTemplates/{templateId}` + `courseTemplates/{templateId}/weeks/{wNN}`
 * — FROZEN CURRICULUM SNAPSHOTS (v2 decision 2), and the retrospective
 * evidence a snapshot carries with it (decision 3).
 *
 * ## Append-only. There is no update path for template weeks.
 *
 * Saving a finished cohort CREATES a new snapshot; it never overwrites the
 * one it was derived from. `courseTemplateId()` mints a fresh id on every
 * save (slug + random suffix), so two saves labelled "Autumn 2026 final" are
 * two rows, not one row written twice. The template DOC accepts a label edit
 * and a delete, both admin-only and both through routes; the WEEKS
 * subcollection accepts nothing at all — no route writes it after the
 * snapshot batch, and `firestore.rules` denies every client write to both
 * (pinned by `scripts/rules-tests/tests/course-templates.test.mjs`).
 *
 * That immutability is the whole value of the collection. A template is what
 * a cohort was ACTUALLY taught; a template you can edit afterwards is just a
 * second, worse copy of the run.
 *
 * ## Ids are preserved, always. This is the platform invariant.
 *
 * A snapshot copies week doc ids ("w01".."w60") verbatim, and every
 * `material.id` / `exercise.id` / `checklist.id` inside them. So does
 * applying a template back into a run. Member progress is keyed on those ids
 * — `courseProgress/{runId}__{uid}__{itemId}` and
 * `courseExerciseResponses/{runId}__{uid}__{weekId}__{exerciseId}` — so a copy
 * that re-minted ids would silently orphan every check-off and submission the
 * moment the same material was taught again. `templateWeekFields()` below is
 * the one function both directions of the copy go through, and NOTHING in
 * this module generates an id except `courseTemplateId`, which names the
 * snapshot itself. (`tests/course-templates.test.mjs` asserts the round trip.)
 *
 * The same property is why the copy is a plain field carry-over rather than a
 * re-author: see `clone-weeks/route.ts`, whose id-preserving copy this
 * mirrors deliberately.
 *
 * ## Retrospective lives here too, on purpose
 *
 * `aggregateRetrospective()` powers BOTH
 * `GET /api/courses/runs/[runId]/retrospective` (the read view) and the
 * `retrospective` summary stamped onto a snapshot at save time. One module
 * owning both is what stops the number on the snapshot card disagreeing with
 * the table an admin read the minute before they pressed save — and, more
 * importantly, keeps the anonymity floor in ONE place.
 *
 * This module is deliberately isomorphic (no `server-only`, no
 * `firebase-admin`): the admin client imports the types and the normaliser,
 * the routes do their own Firestore reads and hand the rows in.
