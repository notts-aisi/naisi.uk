/**
 * Membership periods and the tier rows that hang off them.
 *
 * ## The shape, and why it is zero-migration
 *
 * A PERIOD is one year of society membership: `membershipPeriods/2026-27`,
 * whose `year` field is the string `"2026/27"` verbatim. That string is
 * exactly what `users.paidMembershipYears` has always stored, so the cache
 * every existing badge already reads (the applications queue, the allocation
 * board, the admin Members row) keeps working with nothing migrated. The doc
 * id drops the slash only because a Firestore doc id cannot contain one.
 *
 * A MEMBERSHIP is one person in one period: `memberships/{uid}__{periodId}`.
 * Deterministic and construct-only, so a second grant for the same year is an
 * update to one row rather than a second row nobody would notice.
 *
 * `config/membership` holds the CURRENT pointer (`currentPeriodId`). It lives
 * there rather than as a `current: true` flag on a period because a flag can
 * be true on two documents at once, and "which year is the badge about" has
 * exactly one answer at a time.
 *
 * ## The cache and the row say different things
 *
 * The row is the record: tier, source, how the person was matched, and who
 * granted it. `users.paidMembershipYears` is a QUERYABLE CACHE of one bit of
 * it, "does this account count as a member for that year", written in the same
 * atomic write as the row by the grant route and by nothing else. `alumni` is
 * the tier that separates them: an alumni row exists and is a fact about the
 * person, and it never enters the cache, because they are not a member of the
 * society this year.
 *
 * ## A revoke DELETES the row
 *
 * Taking a membership away removes `memberships/{uid}__{periodId}` and the
 * cache entry together rather than stamping `revokedAt`, because a row that
 * survives its revoke reads as a membership to anything that forgets to check
 * the field. `MembershipDoc.revokedAt` and `revokedByUid` are normalised for a
 * row written by hand or by a later importer that prefers to keep history;
 * nothing in the shipped code writes them.
 *
 * ## Membership gates nothing
 *
 * It is a badge and a record. No route, rule or page may branch access on it:
 * the owner's decision is that members are promoted by hand and that this
 * surface only ever describes what the SU list says. Reviewers do not see it
 * at all; the final decider and admins do.
