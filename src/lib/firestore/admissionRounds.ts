/**
 * `admissionRounds/{roundId}`: one intake. The object an applicant applies
 * TO, and the object a reviewer reviews FOR.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a field on a course run
 *
 * V2 hung applications off `courseRuns.applicationForm`, which made "the
 * thing you apply to" and "the thing you are placed on" the same document.
 * That does not survive contact with the autumn intake: one round feeds the
 * research incubator AND up to three fellowship runs, an incubator reject is
 * offered a fellowship place, and the facilitator round feeds no run at all.
 * A round is therefore its own object with `outcomeRunIds` pointing at the
 * runs it can place people on, and the round id is NEVER derived from a run
 * id.
 *
 * ## Routes-only, and read:false as well as write:false
 *
 * Rules are `allow read, write: if false` for the round AND its stages. The
 * write half is the usual reason (counters, role arrays, PII adjacency). The
 * READ half is the sharper one and is worth stating, because a signed-in read
 * looks harmless:
 *
 *  - `applicationCounts` is live. Signed-in-readable, any fresher can watch a
 *    competitive intake's submitted / accepted / rejected counters move in
 *    real time, all through the week their own application is being decided.
 *  - `finalDeciderUid` names the person who decides their application.
 *  - `criteria` carries the guidance reviewers score against.
 *
 * Every staff surface reads a round through `GET /api/admissions/rounds` and
 * the public round page is a server component on the Admin SDK, so the read
 * rule bought nothing anyway. It also removes the question of a `get()` in a
 * read rule entirely: there is no read rule to put one in.
 *
 * ## THE ROUND DOCUMENT CARRIES NO `questions` FIELD
 *
 * Not a style rule. Question text lives ONLY in the `stages` subcollection,
 * whose whole existence is the timed-release guarantee (see
 * `src/lib/admissions/stageRelease.ts`). Any copy of a question onto a
 * document a client can read defeats it, and this is the shape that makes the
 * mistake structurally hard rather than merely discouraged. The emulator
 * suite asserts that no document under a client-readable path carries a
 * `questions` key.

 * The reminder schedule, read through the SHARED slot sanitiser.

 *
 *  - **A stored LIST is taken at its word, presets and all.** `sanitizeSlots`
 *    falls back to the presets when nothing usable survives, which is the
 *    right answer for a document that never carried the field at all
 *    (restored by hand, written by an older build) and the wrong one for a
 *    document that carried a list. An author who deletes every row is saying
 *    "this round sends none", and the rest of the system already honours
 *    that: the scheduler job skips a round with no slots and Send now refuses
 *    one, so handing back three presets here would start mailing a round that
 *    had been told not to.
 *
 *    The fallback is `[]` for the WHOLE array case rather than only for the
 *    empty one, because a list nobody can read must fail the same way a list
 *    that is empty does. `sanitizeSlots` is stricter than the normaliser it
 *    replaced (that one turned a missing `daysBefore` into 0, this one drops
 *    the row), so `[{ id: "dday", atLocalTime: "12:00" }]` sanitises to
 *    nothing, and falling back there would turn one deadline-day reminder
 *    into three emails on a round only a restore or a hand edit could have
 *    left in that state. Silence is the safe reading of a list we cannot
 *    parse; three sends is not.
 *  - **The old ids survive.** `t7`, `t3` and `dday` are simply valid slot ids
 *    now, kept verbatim rather than migrated, so a round authored before the
 *    free list existed resolves to the same dates and claims the same markers.
