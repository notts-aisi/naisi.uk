/**
 * `courseGroups/{id}` (top-level) — the small facilitated groups inside a
 * course run. Doc id = `slugId(runLabel + name)`; `runId`/`courseId` are
 * stored as queryable fields.
 *
 * Groups carry the weekly session slot and the meeting link, so READ access
 * is restricted (admin / draft / approve holders + the group's facilitators);
 * members get their own group's card via a server route. `facilitatorUids`
 * and `memberCount` are server-owned (routes only, pinned in rules) — the
 * member count is maintained by the allocation transaction so it can never
 * drift from the enrolment docs it summarises.
 *
 * ## Per-group autonomy (v2 decision 4 — COPY-ON-WRITE)
 *
 * A group reads its run's canonical weeks and calendar until its facilitator
 * first personalises them:
 *
 *  - CONTENT forks per week into `courseGroups/{groupId}/weeks/{wNN}`
 *    (`GroupWeekDoc` below) via the fork route. An unforked week keeps
 *    tracking the run canonical, so admin refinements propagate right up to
 *    the moment a facilitator makes the week their own. Nothing ever merges
 *    back.
 *  - CALENDAR overrides live on this doc as `paceStartDate`/`paceWeekPlan`,
 *    both `null` (= track the run) until the pace route sets them.
 *
 * Every consumer resolves group-first through `src/lib/courses/groupResolve.ts`
 * — NOTHING resolves group content ad hoc.
 *
 * `paceStartDate`, `paceWeekPlan` and the `sessionModes` map (the stored form
 * of every override's `mode` — see `GroupSessionMode`) are SERVER-OWNED like
 * `memberCount` (pinned in rules for the non-admin client lanes; the
 * pace/session routes are the writers). The rest of the session fields stay
 * facilitator-editable client-direct, exactly as before.

/*
 * V3 SEAM, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT HERE.
 *
 * The contract specifies ONE field on this document that this PR does not
 * ship:
 *
 *   courseGroups.extraSession: GroupSession | null
 *     A second weekly slot for a group that meets twice. Readers would be
 *     `resolveSessions`, the register's columns and the session cards.
 *
 * It is not built because it has a BLOCKING PRECONDITION that is an owner
 * decision, not a coding one: the pre-course cadence (does a group ever meet
 * twice in a week, and if so is the second meeting a fixed extra slot or an
 * irregular date). Until that is answered the key shape below cannot be
 * chosen, and the key shape is a birth-pinned data decision.
 *
 * THE KEY SHAPE, stated exactly. `sessionOverrides` and `sessionModes` are
 * both `Record<weekId, ...>` (weekId = "w03"), with NO occurrence component.
 * So a group meeting twice in one week cannot move, virtualise or
 * room-notice one of its two sessions: both requests address the same key.
 * Adding `extraSession` (or the pre-committed fallback for an irregular
 * rhythm, an explicit `sessionDates` list) means re-keying both maps to
 * something like `w03#1` / `w03#2`, which changes what is stored, what
 * firestore.rules pins flat at the `sessionModes` comparison, and what
 * `normalizeCourseGroup` reads.
 *
 * The other half of the same decision is `courseAttendance.occurrence`; see
 * the matching note in `courseAttendance.ts`. They land together or not at
 * all, because a second session with no register is not a session. Start at
 * both.
