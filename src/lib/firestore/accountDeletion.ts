 * a record ABOUT them and goes with them, in the same cascade that deletes
 * the membership it wrote.
 *
 * The BATCH documents stay, and so do rows that were never matched to an
 * account. A batch is the provenance behind every membership row it wrote, and
 * deleting it would leave those memberships claiming a source with nothing
 * behind it. An unmatched row names somebody who has no account here at all,
 * so this deletion is not theirs to trigger: it is a line from a file the
 * society received, kept with the file. The batch's counters are NOT adjusted
 * for the same reason the period totals are: they describe what the file did
 * when it was committed, which is still true.
 *
 * ## Why a collection-group query, and the check that comes with it
 *
 * The rows live in a subcollection under an unbounded number of batches, so
 * addressing them would mean reading every batch first. `rows` is a short and
 * generic collection-group name, so each document is re-checked to be under
 * `membershipImports` before it is deleted: a `rows` subcollection added
 * anywhere else in the future must not be swept by this.
 *
 * A collection group gets NO automatic single-field index, so this query only
 * runs at all because `firestore.indexes.json` declares a COLLECTION_GROUP
 * override on `rows.matchedUid`. That override has to be deployed before the
 * first import writes a row, or the sweep fails FAILED_PRECONDITION.

/**
 * Delete this account's admission applications AND their access-requirements
 * rows, a page at a time.
 *
 * ## Why these two cannot be separate sweeps
 *
 * `admissionApplicationPrivate` holds the answer to "is there anything we
 * should know about access requirements?", which in practice means disability
 * and health information. It deliberately carries NOTHING but that answer
 * (no `uid`, no `roundId`), because the collection's whole design is that no
 * reader can join it by accident. The price of that is that it has no field
 * to query on: the ONLY handle back to a private row is the application id it
 * shares, `${roundId}__${uid}`.
 *
 * So a private sweep that ran after the applications were gone would have
 * nothing left to address, and the rows would sit in an
 * `allow read, write: if false` collection that nothing on the site could
 * name: the most sensitive text in the whole intake, permanently
 * unreachable and undeletable. The `clearCourseAttendanceMarks` ordering
 * lesson in its sharpest form.
 *
 * The answer is not "order them carefully": it is ONE BATCH. Each page
 * deletes the private rows and the applications that name them together, so
 * a failure leaves both, and a retry (re-reading the smaller remainder) is
 * the same operation again.
 *
 * That is also why the page size is `ADMISSION_PAGE_SIZE` (250) and not the
 * 300 the other course sweeps use: two deletes per row against Firestore's
 * 500-write batch cap.
 *
 * ## The counters are deliberately left alone
 *
 * Deleting an application does NOT move `admissionRounds.applicationCounts`.
 * That matches what this function already does for `courseApplications` and
 * `courseRuns.applicationCounts`, and the reason is the same: the counter is
 * moved inside the apply / submit / decide transactions, and an out-of-band
 * decrement here would be a second writer of a number those transactions
 * treat as theirs. Account deletion during a live intake is rare and
 * out-of-band by nature, and the round's recount route is the repair.
 * (Group `memberCount` IS decremented below, because a seat left held blocks
 * a real person from taking it.)

/**
 * Count what this cascade KEEPS: the member's worksheet work, and their member

 *
 * ## Why the responses are counted through the tasks
 *
 * A response lives at `circulations/{circulationId}/responses/{uid}`, filed
 * under the act of sending rather than under the person, so there is no
 * uid-keyed query to run: the only handle back to one is a circulation id.
 * Reaching them all by hand would mean listing every circulation the society
 * has ever sent, and reaching them in one query would mean a collection-group
 * index that nothing else here needs.
 *
 * The circulate route writes ONE TASK per recipient beside each response
 * (`src/lib/worksheets/mint.ts`): `source: "worksheet"`, the recipient as the
 * sole completer. Those tasks are retained by the same policy that retains
 * every other task, so the member's worksheet tasks ARE the addressable index
 * of their responses, they outlive this cascade, and the number stays
 * re-derivable long after the summary that reported it was read.
 *
 * THE ONE WAY THAT INDEX DIVERGES, said out loud because a silent
 * under-report is worse than a stated limit: `deleteTask`
 * (`src/features/tasks/taskMutations.ts`) removes a task without touching the
 * response it was minted beside, so a committee member who tidies a worksheet
 * task off the board takes a row off this count while the answers themselves
 * stay exactly where they were. The number is therefore a floor, not a census,
 * and a low count is the safe direction: it never claims data is held that is

 * ## What is NOT counted, said out loud
 *
 * Reviews this member wrote as STAFF about other people live at
 * `circulations/{id}/reviews/{theOtherPersonsUid}`: under somebody else's
 * document id, in a subcollection nothing indexes across circulations, with
 * the author recorded only as `updatedByUid` inside it. Counting them needs a
 * collection-group query and therefore a declared collection-group index,
 * which is a schema change and a deploy for one number on a summary. So they
 * are not counted, and this summary does not imply that they were. The reviews
 * written ABOUT this member ride with the response they assess: retained, and
 * inside the responses count above.
 *
 * Both reads are aggregations, so a member with years of worksheets costs two
 * counts rather than pages of documents.

/**
 * Cascade-delete an account by uid — the single source of truth for "delete this
 * account," reused by the admin Members delete, the collaborator delete, the
 * admin registrations-tracker delete, and the self-service unfinished-account
 * delete. Centralising this is what fixes the ghost-row bug: every deletion path
 * now tears down the `registrations` tracker doc instead of leaving it dangling.
 *
 * Ordering rationale:
 *  - Subscription ROWS go first and are FATAL on failure — a surviving row would
 *    keep mailing a deleted user. Their append-only event log is best-effort
 *    (the rows are already gone, so a stale audit line is acceptable degradation,
 *    mirroring safeRecordEvent) and must NOT abort the rest of the teardown.
 *    The PUSH subscription rows follow them, as the account's other delivery
 *    channel, but best-effort rather than fatal: step 1c argues why a device
 *    endpoint is not the same kind of survivor as a mailing row.
 *  - COURSE data goes before Auth for the same reason as everything else in the
 *    best-effort block: a failure there must not cost the caller the Auth
 *    deletion. Within it, attendance is cleared BEFORE the enrolments are
 *    deleted — the enrolments are what name the runs to scan — and the enrolment
 *    delete is SKIPPED OUTRIGHT when that sweep fails. Ordering alone is not
 *    enough, because the two steps are separately best-effort: the enrolment
 *    rows are the ONLY uid→runIds index in the data model, and `courseAttendance`
 *    is `allow read, write: if false`, so nothing (client or admin surface) can
 *    scan it for a uid once they are gone. Worse, the retry the 207 asks for
 *    would then read an EMPTY enrolment snapshot, sweep zero runs, report zero
 *    marks cleared WITHOUT failing, and clear the tracker row — a clean-looking
 *    200 over marks that are now unreachable and unnameable. So the dependency
 *    is enforced in code, not merely implied by the order of the two blocks.
 *  - The Auth user is deleted near-LAST so a late failure leaves at worst a
 *    benign Auth orphan, never a half-account with dangling profile docs. If Auth
 *    deletion fails the account survives, so its refresh tokens are revoked
 *    (best-effort) — otherwise a "deleted" account keeps live sessions elsewhere.
 *  - The `registrations` tracker row is deleted ONLY AFTER a FULLY CLEAN teardown
 *    (Auth gone AND no best-effort step failed). If anything was left behind, the
 *    row is intentionally kept so the orphan stays visible in the tracker for a
 *    retry — clearing it would strand untracked residue (e.g. PII-bearing
 *    emailVerifications tokens) invisible to the very tool built to surface it.
 *    A re-run is idempotent (auth/user-not-found counts as success) and clears
 *    the row once the failed step succeeds.
 *
 * SCOPE: deletes registration-stage + identity data — subscriptions (+ their
 * event log), the push subscription rows for this account's devices, the
 * registrations row, the collaborators doc, the users doc, the account's
 * email-verification token docs, and the Auth user. It deliberately
 * does NOT delete a member's substantive content (tasks, comments, attachments,
 * events, RSVPs, bookings), which is retained.
 *
 * COURSE DATA IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, and deliberately so. Every course row is
 * keyed to the uid rather than owned by a doc anyone can still administer:
 * `courseApplications` carries the applicant's EMAIL and a denormalised name,
 * `courseProgress` carries public comments the whole cohort reads,
 * `courseExerciseResponses` carries member-authored text a facilitator queue
 * serves, and `courseAttendance` carries participation marks. With the users
 * doc gone every one of those renders as an anonymous ghost row ("NAISI
 * member") that no admin surface can find or clear — so they go with the
 * account.
 *
 * ADMISSIONS DATA GOES FOR THE SAME REASON, and one part of it goes for a
 * stronger one. `admissionApplications` carries the essays and the email;
 * `admissionReviews` carries other people's written assessments of this
 * person, and this person's written assessments of others;
 * `memberConductFlags` carries a free-text allegation. All are keyed to the
 * uid alone. And `admissionApplicationPrivate` holds the access-requirements
 * answer, which will in practice contain disability and health information
 * and which has NO field to query on by design; see
 * `deleteAdmissionApplications` for why that makes it the one row that must
 * die in the same batch as its application rather than in a sweep of its own.
 * The reviewer-authored retention decision is argued at its call site rather
 * than left silent.
 *
 * MIRRORED MY WORK TASKS ARE RETAINED. The week-mirror writes `tasks/{id}` docs
 * (courseTasks.ts) which look like course data but are ordinary task rows — the
 * member is creator and sole completer, `assignees-only`, dismissible like any
 * quick-add. They belong to the tasks collection, which this function leaves
 * alone end to end; carving one `source: "fellowship-reminder"` slice out
 * of it here would leave the member's other tasks behind while breaking the
 * blocks/comments/activity a task carries, and would put this function in the
 * business of deleting content the retention rule above says to keep.
 *
 * THE UNMARKED-REGISTER FOLLOW-UP IS RETAINED TOO, and for a second reason on
 * top of that one. `tasks` carrying `source: "course-register"` name every
 * admin as a completer, so an admin closing their account is named on every
 * card the scheduler has ever raised. They are not that admin's content: the
 * card is the committee's record that a cohort was chased, its subject is a
 * group's register rather than a person, and it carries no PII beyond a uid
 * list. Sweeping them on a completer uid would erase the chase history of
 * every live cohort because one admin left. The uid itself goes stale on the
 * card exactly as it does on any other committee task; the run's own destroy
 * takes these rows in full (courseDeletion.ts, the `registerTasks` stage).
 *
 * WORKSHEET WORK AND THE MEMBER RECORD ARE RETAINED, AND COUNTED. A deleted
 * account's worksheet responses and the staff reviews of them STAY, exactly as
 * its tasks do, and the deletion summary states how many, so the policy can be
 * changed knowingly rather than discovered by somebody hunting for data that
 * has gone. The reasoning is the tasks reasoning with one addition: a response is
 * substantive content the committee holds (the answers to a document the
 * committee sent, and the notes it wrote about them), and it hangs off the
 * circulation rather than off the person, so it is not a ghost row the way an
 * unowned `courseApplications` row is. The member record
 * (`memberRecords/{uid}/applications`: when they applied, what for, the
 * outcome, how they scored, what the reviewers wrote) is kept for the same
 * reason `dataExports` rows are, and it is the rule the whole deletion wave is
 * built around: a destroy never deletes what the committee wants to remember
 * about a person, and neither does an account deletion. Both are COUNTED and
 * neither is touched; `countRetainedMemberWork` has the how, and names the one
 * thing it deliberately does not count.

  //     A failure here costs the summary two honest numbers and nothing else,

  //     resurface the account as an orphan in the registrations tracker over a
  //     count of data that nobody lost, which is the ghost row this function
  //     exists to stop. It DOES earn a sentence in the warning, because the

  //     "there was nothing to keep".

  //     in the same request as every best-effort step above, so it fails for
  //     the same transient causes they do (deadline exceeded, unavailable,
  //     quota) and the two failures arrive together. A warning written here
  //     would then occupy the field the residue sentence needs, the
  //     `partialFailure` block at the end would find it already set and stay
  //     quiet, and the admin would read a note about a missing telemetry number
  //     while the registration row was deliberately kept for a re-run. Both
