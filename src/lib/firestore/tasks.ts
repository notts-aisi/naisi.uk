 * unmarked past its grace window: assigned to the admins, about one (run,
 * group, session). A task's id says nothing about who made it, so the job
 * that raises it reads the task back when the id is already taken, and checks
 * `source`, `sourceRef.cohortId` and the admin completers before treating it as
 * its own; otherwise it logs it and mints at a fallback id.
 *
 * `worksheet` is one recipient's copy of a circulated worksheet: minted by
 * POST /api/worksheets/circulations, one task per recipient, always
 * `assignees-only`, never created by a client.
 *
 * Nothing trusts the `worksheet` label on its own: the respond page and the
 * worksheet panel key on the `artefact` pointer below AND on the circulation's
 * own response document, which only the worksheet routes write.
