/**
 * `destroyAudits/{autoId}`: one row per destroy attempt, for every cascade
 * that is NOT a course.
 *
 * ## What it is
 *
 * The audit half of `courseDeletion.ts`, lifted out and made generic. A row is
 * opened BEFORE the first delete, accumulates per-collection counts as the
 * cascade drains, and is stamped `completedAt` when the cascade finishes. So a
 * row with `completedAt: null` is durable evidence of an INTERRUPTED destroy,
 * which is the property the whole design is for: the rows a destroy removes
 * are gone, so if the cascade dies half way there is nothing else left to say
 * it ever ran, what it was told to remove, or how far it got.
 *
 * That is the same argument the impersonation log and `accountDeletion`'s
 * keep-the-tracker-row rule make. It is worth restating because the tempting
 * simplification (write the row at the END, when the counts are known) turns
 * every crash into an untracked deletion.
 *
 * ## Why a SECOND collection rather than a `kind` field on `courseDeletions`
 *
 * The obvious move is to widen the existing one. It is the wrong move, and the
 * reason is not tidiness:
 *
 *  - `courseDeletions` is only half of that protocol. The other half is a
 *    MARKER stamped on the course or run document itself (`destroying: true`,
 *    `destroyAuditId`), written in the same transaction as the row, and the
 *    pass LEASE that stops two invocations double-counting is read through
 *    that marker. Both halves live on the courses documents. A circulation, a
 *    worksheet and an admission round have no such field and no reason to grow
 *    one, so reusing the collection would mean either bolting a marker field
 *    onto three unrelated documents or maintaining two different resume
 *    mechanisms behind one collection name.
 *  - `readInterruptedDestroy` in `courseDeletion.ts` is a single `get()`
 *    precisely BECAUSE the marker names its row. Without a marker the same
 *    question is a query, which is what `readInterruptedDestroyAudit` below
 *    is, and a query with different index needs from the get it would be
 *    sharing a collection with.
 *  - The two collections' rules and cascades are already independent: a course
 *    destroy drains `courseAudit` rows for its run, and nothing here should be
 *    reachable by that cascade or by any other.
 *
 * So the course engine keeps `courseDeletions` and this file keeps
 * `destroyAudits`. Both are `allow read: if isAdmin()` and `allow write: if
 * false`, and neither is swept by account deletion.
 *
 * ## The resume shape this supports
 *
 * There is no marker, so a resume is found by asking the collection: the
 * newest row for this (kind, targetId) with no `completedAt`. A cascade built
 * on this module therefore:
 *
 *  1. calls `readInterruptedDestroyAudit` and resumes into the row it names,
 *     or `openDestroyAudit` when there is none;
 *  2. calls `accumulateDestroyAudit` as it drains, so the totals survive a
 *     pass that runs out of budget;
 *  3. calls `completeDestroyAudit` when the last page is gone.
 *
 * The counts are the ACCUMULATED totals of the whole destroy rather than one
 * pass's own, for the reason `courseDeletion.ts` argues at length: a resume can
 * begin in a different browser tab from the one that started the cascade, and
 * only the server can state what the whole destroy has removed.
 *
 * ## Rows are keys, never user data
 *
 * `accumulateDestroyAudit` writes each count at the dotted path
 * `deleted.<key>`, which is a deliberate nested-map update. The keys are the
 * cascade's own fixed stage identifiers (`responses`, `reviews`, `tasks`), so
 * the dotted path is safe here in a way it would not be for a map keyed by
 * anything a person supplied: a key containing a dot would silently write a
 * nested field. Do not pass a key that came from a document.
