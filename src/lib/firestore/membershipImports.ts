/**
 * The SU membership list, as it arrives: a batch document per upload and one
 * ROW DOCUMENT per line of the file.
 *
 * ## Rows live in a subcollection, and the commit reads them from there
 *
 * `membershipImports/{batchId}/rows/{NNNN}`, ids zero-padded so they sort in
 * file order without a stored index. Two reasons, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - a real SU list is thousands of lines. Rows on the parent document would
 *    approach the 1MB document limit, so a file could be REPORTED on in full
 *    and only partly committable, which is the worst kind of half-working;
 *  - the commit route reads the rows it acts on FROM FIRESTORE, never from
 *    the request body. The name tier is confirm-only precisely because a name
 *    is weak evidence, and a commit that trusted a posted row would let the
 *    browser hand over any uid it liked with a name match already stamped on
 *    it. The body carries row IDS to confirm and nothing else.
 *
 * ## The three tiers of match, and why the third cannot auto-commit
 *
 * In order, per row:
 *
 *  1. the VERIFIED university email on an account (`profile.universityEmail`
 *     with `uniEmailVerifiedAt` set), case-folded. Somebody proved they own
 *     that address by clicking a link we sent to it, so this is the only
 *     match backed by evidence;
 *  2. the account's sign-in email, case-folded. Weaker: nobody proved it here,
 *     but Google did, and the SU list carries the address a person typed on a
 *     society form, so a hit is a person saying "this is me" twice;
 *  3. a normalised display name. NEVER auto-committed. Two students share a
 *     name often enough that the false positive is not hypothetical, and the
 *     cost of getting it wrong is recording that somebody paid when they did
 *     not, and telling somebody else they did not when they did. A name row
 *     commits only when its row id is in the commit call's `confirmedRowIds`,
 *     and the row then stamps WHO confirmed it.
 *
 * A name that matches two or more accounts is not a match at all: there is
 * nothing for a human to confirm except a coin toss, so it is reported
 * unmatched with the reason written out.
 *
 * ## Account deletion, and what happens to a batch
 *
 * A row NAMES A PERSON: the name and email on the SU list, and the uid it was
 * matched to. `deleteMembershipImportRows` sweeps rows by `matchedUid` when an
 * account is deleted, in the same cascade that deletes their membership rows.
 *
 * The RETENTION DECISION, stated here so a later reader does not have to infer
 * it from the code: BATCH DOCUMENTS ARE RETAINED, and rows that were never
 * matched to an account are retained with them. A batch is the provenance
 * behind every membership row it wrote ("this came from the SU list uploaded
 * on the 9th of October"), and deleting the batch would leave those
 * memberships claiming a source with nothing behind it. An unmatched row names
 * somebody who has no account here at all, so an account deletion is not their
 * deletion and cannot be treated as one: it is a line from a file the society
 * received, kept with the file. What goes is the row for the account being
 * deleted, because that row is about them and the membership it wrote is being
 * deleted in the same pass.
 *
 * ## Not in the courses destroy manifest, deliberately
 *
 * The course and run DESTROY cascades do not touch either collection and no
 * manifest entry is owed: an import is scoped to a MEMBERSHIP PERIOD, which is
 * a year of the society, not to a course, a run or a group. Destroying a run
 * has nothing to say about who paid their SU membership that year.
