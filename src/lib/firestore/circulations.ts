/**
 * `circulations/{circulationId}` and its two subcollections: one act of
 * sending a worksheet to people. See `docs/worksheets.md` for the contract.
 *
 * Three shapes, and the split between them is the whole access model:
 *
 *  - the CIRCULATION carries the semi-frozen copy of the questions, who is
 *    staff, and the counters. Its `staffUids` array is the single thing every
 *    rule and every staff list query keys off, because a rule cannot join.
 *  - a RESPONSE (`responses/{uid}`) is one recipient's answers. Its doc id IS
 *    the recipient's uid, so "may I read this" is `uid == request.auth.uid`
 *    with no lookup, and "prove you are a recipient" is one `exists()` on the
 *    circulation's read rule.
 *  - a REVIEW (`reviews/{uid}`) is the staff-only notes and SCORES about that
 *    response. It is a separate document rather than a field on the response
 *    precisely so that "the recipient reads their own response" and "scores
 *    are never seen by the recipient" are the same rule rather than two rules
 *    that have to agree. Returning feedback COPIES the parts the toggles allow
 *    onto the response; scores are never copied.
 *
 * Runtime dependency runs one way only: this module imports `sanitizeItems`
 * from `worksheets.ts`, and `worksheets.ts` imports only the `ReviewConfig`
 * TYPE back (erased at compile time). See the comment at the top of that file.

 *
 *  1. NO RULES CHANGE AND NO DEPLOY. The circulations update rule in
 *     `firestore.rules` limits a staff write to a fixed key list, one of
 *     which is `notifications`. A new top-level `reminderSlots` field would
 *     be refused by that `hasOnly` until a rules change was deployed; a leaf
 *     write to `notifications.dueSoon.slots` reports `notifications` as its
 *     affected key, exactly as `notifications.dueSoon.email` already does.
 *  2. It is the reminder's own timing, so it belongs beside the reminder's
 *     own switches. The switches stay the on and off: a circulation with
 *     both channels off sends nothing whatever its schedule says, and the
 *     scheduler job drops it before it reads a single response.
 *
 * The other four events keep the plain two-switch shape, because none of them
 * is scheduled: each fires from something that just happened.
