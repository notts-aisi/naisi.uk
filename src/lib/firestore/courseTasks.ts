/**
 * Task mirroring — projecting a course week into a member's My Work board as
 * a `tasks/{id}` doc. One-way, lazy, and CRON-FREE (App Hosting has no
 * scheduler): the sync-tasks route runs on course-page/dashboard mount,
 * short-circuits on `enrolment.lastTaskSyncedWeek === anchorWeekNumber`, and
 * otherwise `.create()`s the task at a DETERMINISTIC id.
 *
 * Deterministic id + `.create()` IS the idempotency guarantee: two racing
 * mounts both target the same doc, the second gets ALREADY_EXISTS and moves
 * on. No transactions, no "does it exist" query, no duplicate tasks ever.
 *
 * The task uses the hooks pre-provisioned in tasks.ts: `source:
 * "fellowship-reminder"`, `kind: "fellowship-weekly"`, and `sourceRef:
 * {cohortId, weekNumber}` (populated here for the first time). The member is
 * creator AND sole completer, visibility is `assignees-only`, so it behaves
 * exactly like their personal quick-add tasks — including dismissal, via the
 * rules' fellowship-reminder delete branch.

 * itself at. This value alone does not identify a follow-up. What does is the

 * writes a subtask the board can never render, so `subtaskStats.total` counts
 * rows that do not exist and the member's progress pill reads "0/3" over two
 * visible rows, permanently and unfixably (a mirror's title is outside the
 * completer's narrow write band).
 *
 * So the filter is part of the projection, not defensive noise: what this

 *
 * Load-bearing choices:
 *  - Subtask ids REUSE the checklist item ids: a re-created task (member
 *    dismissed it, admin re-synced) lines up with the same curriculum items.
 *  - Every emitted subtask must SURVIVE `normalizeSubtask` on the way back
 *    out — see `mirrorable()` above for why that is not automatic.
 *  - `initialNotifyAt` is pre-stamped: the task is born "already notified",
 *    so the task-email machinery never emails about a mirror — the course's
 *    own week-nudge email owns that moment.
 *  - `visibility: "assignees-only"` + creator === completer === member keeps
 *    the mirror inside the member's personal lane; it never appears on the
