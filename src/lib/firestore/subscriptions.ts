/**
 * Junction collection for newsletter / events / cohort-channel subscriptions.
 * Each row is one (recipient, channel) pair. Replaces per-doc booleans on
 * `users/{uid}.profile.notifications.categories` (members) and the previously
 * planned `subscribers/{id}.subscriptions` shape (guests).
 *
 * Why a junction table:
 *  - Adding a new channel (e.g. `cohort:fall-2026`) is data, not schema.
 *  - "Who is subscribed to channel X right now?" is a single indexed query
 *    on `(channel, confirmed, subscribed)`.
 *  - Member-migration on register is a row-level audience flip
 *    (`guest` → `user`), no merge / delete / duplicate-up risk.
 *
 * Doc-id convention: `sub_<sanitisedEmail>__<channel>`. The slug prefix keeps
 * Firestore browseable. The (sanitisedEmail, channel) suffix is deterministic,
 * so the same pair always maps to the same doc, so `set({ merge: true })` gives
 * idempotent upserts.
 *
 * Channel-string convention:
 *  - Top-level lists: lowercase, no prefix. `newsletter`, `events`.
 *  - Scoped lists: `<scope>:<id>`, lowercase kebab after the colon.
 *    Examples: `cohort:fall-2026`, `track:technical`.
 *
 * STATE MODEL (the orthogonal-axes thing):
 *
 * Two separate, orthogonal axes per row, instead of one collapsed enum:
 *
 *   confirmed: boolean             // has this email proven inbox control?
 *   confirmedAt: Timestamp?        // when first confirmed (audit + lifetime stamp)
 *   subscribed: boolean            // does the recipient currently want this channel?
 *   subscribedAt: Timestamp?       // last time it became true (audit)
 *   unsubscribedAt: Timestamp?     // last time it became false (audit, never wiped)
 *
 * Rationale: previously a single `status: pending | confirmed | unsubscribed`
 * collapsed both axes, so re-subscribing after unsubscribing wiped the
 * "they were once confirmed" signal and lost the unsub history. The split
 * keeps a complete audit trail and makes the sender query a clean two-
 * predicate filter (`confirmed && subscribed`).
 *
 * `confirmed` is a sticky-once-true boolean: after a row's confirmedAt is
 * stamped, the boolean never flips back to false. Toggling subscribed
 * doesn't touch confirmed. Re-subscribe is a one-step "set subscribed=true",
 * not a re-confirmation flow, because the inbox is already proven.
 *
 * Confirmation gate: a row mints as confirmed only when the caller passes
 * `inboxProven` (a signed-in user subscribing one of their own verified
 * emails). Every other row is pending until the recipient clicks the
 * confirm link. One click flips every pending row for that address at once
 * (`confirmAllForEmail`), so the click is still gathered once per address,
 * not once per channel. `subscribe()` never infers proof from a sibling
 * confirmed row.
