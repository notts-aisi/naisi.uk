/**
 * Human-readable Firestore doc IDs: `{slug}__{8-char-base36}`.
 *
 * Goal: Firebase Console stays scannable as the corpus grows. Random auto-IDs
 * make it impossible to find a specific doc by eye; a slug prefix means the
 * title/kind/filename is visible at a glance and the suffix still guarantees
 * uniqueness.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *  - slug: lowercase `[a-z0-9-]`; max 40 chars; empty/unusable source → `"untitled"`
 *  - separator: `__` (double underscore) — makes `splitOnce` unambiguous
 *  - suffix: 8 base36 chars (~2.8 trillion combos) from the platform's
 *    cryptographic generator, so one id says nothing about the next
 *
 * Forward-only — existing random IDs keep their shape; we only apply this
 * convention at doc-creation time.
 *
 * NB: Firestore doc IDs can't start with `__`. A slug is always non-empty (we
 * fall back to `"untitled"`), so `${slug}__${suffix}` never starts with `__`.
