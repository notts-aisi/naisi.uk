/**
 * DESTROY — the irreversible half of the courses deletion protocol (v2 plan,
 * decision 12). Archive is the everyday path; this module is the generalised
 * `accountDeletion.ts` machinery pointed at a course run (or, once every run
 * is gone, a course): admin-only, typed-confirmation at the route, live-count
 * manifest, audit record FIRST, and a resumable paginated cascade.
 *
 * The audit row (`courseDeletions/{auditId}`) is created BEFORE anything is
 * deleted, in the same transaction that marks the run doc — so an audit row
 * with `completedAt: null` is durable evidence of an interrupted destroy, the
 * exact crash-safety property the impersonation log and accountDeletion's
 * keep-the-tracker-row rule both encode. All writes here are Admin SDK;
 * clients get admin READ only (rules owned by the rules suite).
 *
 * RESUMABILITY. Each invocation spends a fixed document budget
 * (`DESTROY_DOC_BUDGET`) and returns `complete: false` when it runs out; the
 * SAME call repeated resumes, because:
 *  - every collection is drained with delete-as-you-read pagination (the
 *    `deleteOwnedCourseRows` pattern): the next query's first page IS the
 *    next unprocessed page, so there is no cursor to persist;
 *  - the run doc is deleted LAST — while it exists, a resumed cascade can
 *    still find everything (the `runId` on every leaf row, the cohort
 *    channel, and the `destroyAuditId` marker that names the audit row to
 *    keep accumulating into);
 *  - the audit row accumulates per-collection counts across invocations, and
 *    each invocation REPORTS those accumulated totals (it reads the row back
 *    after its own increments land) — a resume can start in a different tab
 *    from the one that began the cascade, and only the server can state what
 *    the whole destroy has removed.
 *
 * ONE PASS AT A TIME (`passInFlightUntil`). Two invocations overlapping on the
 * same audit row would both increment it over the same pages — the totals
 * above stop being exact the moment that happens. So each pass CLAIMS the
 * audit row for `PASS_LEASE_MS` inside the same transaction that finds or
 * opens it, and a second invocation arriving inside that window is refused
 * (`DestroyPassInFlightError` → 409) rather than allowed to double-count.
 * This is contention protection, not distributed locking: the lease is
 * released at the end of the pass (and best-effort on a throw), and a process
 * that DIES mid-pass — a Cloud Run instance killed, a request timing out —
 * leaves the claim standing until it expires, so a resume can be up to
 * `PASS_LEASE_MS` away. That window is the deliberate cost of exact totals.
 *
 * THE DRAINED-GUARD THROWS (the P8 lesson, inherited from
 * `deleteOwnedCourseRows` / `clearCourseAttendanceMarks`): a delete that
 * reports success without removing rows would otherwise loop forever while
 * "making progress" on paper — audit counts inflating over rows that are
 * still there. Two guards, both fatal: a page whose first doc id repeats
 * after a committed delete, and a full-pass ceiling. A throw surfaces as a
 * 500 and leaves the marker + open audit row in place for a retry; a silent
 * stop would report a clean destroy over surviving member data.

 * removal: the ROW is what makes an address a recipient
 * (`findRecipientsForChannel` filters on it), so deleting rows is what stops
 * cohort mail; there is no per-row flag worth preserving on a channel that
 * is about to have no run behind it.
 *
 * THE CHANNEL IS COMPUTED, NEVER READ OFF THE RUN. Callers pass
 * `courseRunChannel(runId)`; the stored `courseRuns.channel` field is not
 * consulted anywhere in this module. A run doc carrying `channel:
 * "newsletter"`, however it got there, would otherwise turn one run's destroy
 * into a mass-unsubscribe of the site's whole newsletter list, with the rows
 * gone before anyone read the manifest. Computing it makes that unreachable
 * instead of merely unlikely, and costs nothing: every other consumer of the
 * cohort channel (the send route, the allocation publish, the nudge route,
 * the unsubscribe link) already derives it the same way, so nothing legitimate
 * depends on the stored value.
 *
 * Each page's event-log lines go with their rows (`subscriptionEvents` lives
 * exactly as long as the row it describes — the GDPR-clean rule in
 * subscriptions.ts). Rows first, events best-effort, same as
 * accountDeletion's step 1/1b: once the rows (the mailing source) are gone a
 * stale audit line is acceptable degradation, and it must not abort the
 * cascade — but it IS unrecoverable (the ids that named the events went with
 * the rows), so it is logged loudly. Events are recorded in `extraTotals`
 * and not charged against the budget: they are bounded by their own rows (a
 * handful per subscription).

/**
 * RELEASE, not delete: the admission applications whose outcome placed
 * somebody on this run.
 *
 * ## Why these rows survive a destroy
 *
 * An `admissionApplications` row is a PERSON'S APPLICATION. It belongs to the
 * round and to the applicant, not to the run: it holds the essays they wrote,
 * their availability, their evidence snapshot and the decision that was made
 * about them, and the owner's decision is that applications are kept and
 * stored against the account. One round also feeds several runs, so deleting
 * every application pointing at one destroyed run would take rows belonging
 * to an intake that is still live and still being decided.
 *
 * ## Why they cannot be left untouched either
 *
 * The seat those rows describe is being destroyed. Leaving them says three
 * false things at once: `status: "accepted"` claims a place on a cohort that
 * no longer exists, `outcome.targetRunId` points at a document nothing can
 * resolve, and `seatApplicationId` names a `courseApplications` row this same
 * cascade has already deleted. The status hub would show a live placement on
 * a cohort nothing can open.
 *
 * So each row is RELEASED: `status` becomes `withdrawn`, and the two
 * pointers are cleared. What actually happened is still legible from the row
 * (the decision, the decider, the timestamp and the reason are all
 * untouched) and from the destroy audit row, which records how many were
 * released. Withdrawn is the right terminal status because it is the one the
 * decide route already treats as "holds no seat": reinstating somebody is
 * `withdrawn -> submitted` inside the counter transaction, so a released
 * applicant can be put back into a live round by the route that already
 * exists, rather than needing a repair nobody has written.
 *
 * `withdrawnAt` is deliberately NOT stamped. It records when THE APPLICANT
 * withdrew, and reading it is how the reapply flow and the queue tell a
 * person's own change of mind from anything else; a system release is not
 * that, and back-dating one would put an act on the applicant's record that
 * they never performed. The destroy audit row carries the when, the who and
 * the how many for this release, and `updatedAt` moves, so nothing is lost.
 *
 * ## The round's counters are deliberately NOT moved here
 *
 * A release does not touch `admissionRounds.applicationCounts`, and nothing
 * anywhere in this file writes an `admissionRounds` document (a test pins
 * that). The counters are relative increments owned by the apply, submit and
 * decide transactions; a second writer outside those transactions is how a
 * counter goes wrong, not how it is repaired. And a round outlives every run
 * it fed, so a run destroy must never reach one.
 *
 * The consequence is real and accepted: after a destroy, a round's accepted
 * count can read higher than its rows justify. The repair is the round's own
 * recount, `POST /api/admissions/rounds/[roundId]/recount` (PR33), which
 * rebuilds the numbers from the rows themselves. It is the same repair the
 * account cascade leans on for the same reason.
 *
 * ## Why clearing `outcome.targetRunId` is load-bearing, not tidiness
 *
 * It is also what makes this stage drain. Every other stage here is
 * delete-as-you-read: the page it processes stops matching the query, so the
 * next query's first page IS the next unprocessed page, and the
 * first-doc-id guard can tell "nothing is happening" from "still working".
 * An update that left the row matching would re-read the same page forever
 * and trip that guard on the first pass. Clearing the pointer gives an update
 * the same property a delete has, and it is the honest write regardless: a
 * pointer at a destroyed run is not information.

 *     facilitator material notes — BEFORE the enrolments. This is the
 *     accountDeletion lesson (its attendance sweep runs before the enrolment
 *     delete because the enrolments are what name the runs to scan) carried
 *     over: keep the rows that gate or name a step alive until the step is
 *     done. Here every leaf carries `runId` directly, so the dependency is
 *     not addressability but the WRITE GATE: firestore.rules'
 *     `isEnrolledActive()` lets a member client-write courseProgress until
 *     their enrolment dies, so a member racing the sweep can re-create a row
 *     AFTER its stage drained. That is also why attendance is whole-DOC
 *     deletion here, unlike account deletion's per-uid map-key surgery: there
 *     the register outlived one member; here the register itself is dying
 *     with its run. `courseMaterialNotes` has no such gate (rules deny every
 *     client write to it) and joins the leaves for consistency, not
 *     necessity — but it MUST be drained by something: the notes are staff
 *     assessments of week content this cascade deletes, so left behind they
 *     describe a curriculum nothing can render, for a cohort nothing can
 *     find.
 *  2. Enrolments — immediately after the leaves, which SHUTS the member
 *     write gate (and the enrolment-gated routes: exercises, sync-tasks).
 *     No group memberCount decrement, deliberately — accountDeletion
 *     decrements because its groups SURVIVE the member; here the groups die
 *     below in this same cascade, and a doomed doc's counter is dead bytes.
 *  3. Applications (email PII + denormalised names — same reasoning as
 *     accountDeletion's SCOPE note: with the run gone these render as ghost
 *     rows no surface can find).
 *  4. Machine-minted tasks, in two sweeps on the same collection (see
 *     drainSourcedTasks): the members' My Work week mirrors, then the
 *     committee board's unmarked-register follow-ups. The index note is in
 *     drainSourcedTasks too.
 *  5. Nudge markers (courseNudges) — send-dedupe machinery keyed by runId;
 *     hygiene, so counted in `deleted` but not in the manifest. Then the
 *     scheduler's own markers (schedulerMarkers), which ARE on the manifest:
 *     they must go before the groups, because one of the two families that
 *     names this run is addressed by group id rather than by run id.
 *  6. Subscription rows on the cohort channel + their event log (see
 *     drainSubscriptionRows). After this, nothing can mail the cohort.
 *  7. Groups, then weeks — the structural containers, after everything that
 *     referenced them.
 *  8. The run doc LAST, in the SAME batch as the audit row's `completedAt`
 *     stamp and the parent course's `showcaseRunId` clear (a public course
 *     page must not point its shop window at a destroyed run). While the run
 *     doc exists a resumed cascade can still find everything; deleting it is
 *     the one write that makes the destroy final, so it travels atomically
 *     with the record that says the destroy finished.
 *
 * `emailSends` rows are counted in the manifest but NEVER deleted — they are
 * the append-only deliverability audit, and a destroy erases the run's data,
 * not the record of what NAISI sent people.
 *
 * The drain loop runs FULL PASSES until a pass deletes nothing: pass 1 does
 * the work, and the mandatory zero-delete pass is the verification that
 * closes the leaf-recreation race in step 1 — by the time a pass finds every
 * collection empty, the enrolments (write gate) have been gone since an
 * earlier pass, so nothing can have slipped in behind it.
