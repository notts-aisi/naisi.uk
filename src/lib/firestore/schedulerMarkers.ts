/**
 * `schedulerMarkers`: the single claim-before-send marker collection for
 * EVERY scheduler-tick job.
 *
 * A tick job derives its due work from live data at tick time (no queue, no
 * stored due list), so a missed tick catches up on its own. What stops a
 * caught-up tick re-sending is a marker: a deterministic, construct-only doc
 * id per unit of work, created with `.create()` BEFORE the send and stamped
 * `sentAt` after it.
 *
 * HOUSE RULE. Scheduler-tick markers live here. Human-triggered course send
 * markers stay in `courseNudges` (existing collection, existing rules, no
 * rules deploy). Do not mix the two: this collection is `allow read, write:
 * if false` precisely so a client cannot pre-create an id and suppress a send
 * it does not want, and `courseNudges` is not shaped for that threat.
 *
 * THE RE-CLAIM RULE (the part that is easy to leave out and expensive to
 * leave out). Claim-before-send means a failure BETWEEN the claim and the
 * stamp (one Resend 5xx, one container eviction, one budget cut) leaves a
 * marker with no `sentAt`. Without a recovery rule every later tick derives
 * the same work, sees the marker, and skips: permanent silent non-delivery of
 * exactly the mail somebody is waiting for. So a marker with no `sentAt`
 * whose `claimedAt` is older than `reclaimAfterMinutes` is RECLAIMABLE, up to
 * `maxAttempts` claims in total, after which it is stamped `failedAt` and
 * surfaced with a Retry action on the admin scheduler panel. A stuck marker
 * must be visible, not inferred.
 *
 * Work that is simply too late (a tick that has been down for days) is
 * stamped `skippedReason: "stale"` rather than mailed, per each job's
 * `maxLateHours`. Sending a "your application closes in 7 days" email nine
 * days after the deadline is worse than sending nothing.
 *
 * Every component of a marker id is ALSO stored as a field, so the panel and
 * any future cleanup can query markers without parsing ids.
 *
 * This module is deliberately free of runtime imports so the unit suite can
 * transpile it standalone on the repo's Node 20 (see tests/scheduler.test.mjs).
