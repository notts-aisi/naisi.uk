/**
 * `schedulerRuns`: one receipt per execution of POST /api/scheduler/tick.
 *
 * The receipt does two jobs:
 *
 *  1. DEDUPE. An external scheduler retries on a non-2xx, and can deliver the
 *     same nominal tick twice. The doc id is derived from the request instant
 *     floored to a 15-minute UTC boundary,
 *     so two deliveries inside one bucket resolve to the same id and the
 *     second `.create()` fails with ALREADY_EXISTS. That is the whole dedupe:
 *     no transaction, no lock, no lease.
 *
 *  2. OBSERVABILITY. It is the only place an admin can answer "is the
 *     scheduler running" without server logs, which is what the scheduler
 *     panel on /admin/site-status reads.
 *
 * WHY THE DEPTH SUFFIX IS PART OF THE ID. A tick that runs out of budget
 * re-arms itself by calling the endpoint again with `depth + 1`. That re-arm
 * fires seconds later and therefore floors to the SAME bucket. With a bare
 * `tick__{bucket}` id the re-arm would hit ALREADY_EXISTS and return having
 * done nothing, so depth could never leave 0 and every backlog would wait a
 * full 15 minutes for the next external delivery. `tick__{bucket}__d{depth}`
 * gives every re-arm its own receipt while duplicate EXTERNAL deliveries (all
 * of which arrive at depth 0) still collapse onto one id.
 *
 * Consequence, stated here because it is easy to get wrong at the callsite:
 * the deduped early return applies ONLY at depth 0. A collision at depth > 0
 * is an anomaly, not a duplicate delivery, and the tick proceeds through it
 * (idempotency at depth > 0 comes from the per-work markers in
 * `schedulerMarkers`, never from this receipt).
 *
 * This module is deliberately free of runtime imports so the unit suite can
 * transpile it standalone on the repo's Node 20 (see tests/scheduler.test.mjs).
