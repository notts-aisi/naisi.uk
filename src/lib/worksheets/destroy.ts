/**
 * DESTROY, for worksheets and circulations. The shape is
 * `src/lib/firestore/courseDeletion.ts`'s, deliberately and almost line for
 * line: audit row FIRST, live manifest counts, budgeted resumable pages, a
 * drained-guard that throws rather than looping, and blockers as sentences a
 * person can act on. A fourth deletion protocol with its own habits would be
 * a fourth thing to learn before anybody could trust it.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE TWO OPERATIONS ARE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * DELETING A LIBRARY WORKSHEET is small and is not in this file's cascade
 * sense at all: a worksheet is a document plus a folder of question images,
 * and nothing hangs off it. What is sent hangs off a CIRCULATION, which
 * carries its own copy of the questions. So the worksheet route (`DELETE
 * /api/worksheets/[worksheetId]`) needs only the blocker below and the two
 * deletes, and it takes them from here so the sentence and the storage prefix
 * live beside the circulation's. ONE THREAD DOES RUN BETWEEN THEM: a
 * circulation's copied items point at the WORKSHEET's image folder, so the
 * delete keeps that folder whenever any circulation of the worksheet still
 * exists (see `deleteWorksheetDocument`, which is where the argument is).
 *
 * DESTROYING A CIRCULATION is the real cascade: every recipient's answers,
 * the staff reviews of them, the task on each recipient's board with its
 * comments, activity and attachments, every uploaded answer image, the copy's
 * own question images and the reminder markers. It is ADMIN ONLY (never the
 * sender), which is enforced at the route.
 *
 * ── WHAT SURVIVES, AND WHY THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `emailSends` rows are the append-only record of what NAISI put in somebody's
 * inbox, and `dataExports` rows the append-only record of who took a
 * spreadsheet of it off the platform. Destroying the thing a message was about
 * does not unsend the message or un-download the file, so both are COUNTED on
 * the manifest and never deleted, which is the line every other destroy in this
 * codebase draws.
 *
 * ── RESUMABILITY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each invocation spends a fixed document budget and returns `complete: false`
 * when it runs out; the SAME call repeated resumes. There is no cursor to
 * persist, because every stage drains delete-as-you-read: the page it just
 * removed stops matching its query, so the next query's first page IS the next
 * unprocessed page. The circulation document is deleted LAST, so while it
 * exists a resumed pass can still find everything, including, on the document
 * itself, the id of the audit row to keep accumulating into.
 *
 * ── ONE PASS AT A TIME ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two invocations overlapping on one audit row would both increment it over
 * the same pages, and the running total the operator is reading would stop
 * being true. So a pass CLAIMS the audit row (`claimDestroyAuditPass`) before
 * it drains anything, and a second invocation arriving inside that window is
 * refused with `DestroyPassInFlightError` (409) rather than allowed to double
 * count. The claim lives in the shared audit module rather than here, so the
 * circulation and the admission round contend the same way; see its comments
 * for the window a killed process leaves behind.
 *
 * ── THE DRAINED-GUARD THROWS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A delete that reports success without removing rows would otherwise loop
 * while "making progress" on paper, inflating the audit counts over documents
 * that are still there. Two guards, both fatal: a page whose first document id
 * repeats after a committed delete, and a full-pass ceiling. A throw surfaces
 * as a 500 and leaves the marker and the open audit row in place for a retry;
 * a silent stop would report a clean destroy over surviving member work.

 * ("a destroy whose scope is unknown is not one anybody should be pressing"),

 * Delete one library worksheet: its question images, then the document.

 * IMAGES FIRST, DOCUMENT LAST, the events-delete ordering: a failure part-way
 * leaves the worksheet visible and the delete repeatable, rather than a folder
 * of images nothing names. The Storage half is best-effort, because a blob
 * nobody can reach is a smaller problem than a worksheet that refuses to go.
 *
 * THE PREFIX IS DERIVED FROM THE ID, never read off the document, because a
 * stored path would be a string a client wrote.
 *
 * ── THE FOLDER IS KEPT WHEN ANY CIRCULATION OF THIS WORKSHEET EXISTS ────────
 *
 * This is the one place where deleting a library worksheet CAN reach something
 * already sent, and the reason is that a circulation copies the worksheet's
 * `items` verbatim: an `imageUrl` in that copy points into
 * `worksheet-images/{worksheetId}/` until somebody re-uploads that picture on
 * the circulation's own copy. Sweeping the folder therefore blanks the pictures
 * inside every circulation ever made from this worksheet, closed ones included,
 * which are exactly the archived records the committee keeps. A destroy that
 * quietly reached into other documents would break the promise the rest of this
 * module is built on, so it does not: if a single circulation of this worksheet
 * exists, the images stay and the result says how many and why.
 *
 * The residue is disk: a deleted worksheet whose circulations are later
 * destroyed leaves its folder behind, because the circulation destroy only
 * sweeps `worksheet-images/{circulationId}/`. That is the right way round: an
 * orphaned blob costs pennies, a blank image in a record of what somebody was
 * asked cannot be recovered at all.

/**
 * Begin (or resume) a destroy.
 *
 * A fresh destroy is blocker-checked first (nothing has been written at that
 * point, so a refusal really does leave the circulation exactly as it was).
 * Then the audit row is opened, BEFORE anything can die, so an open row with
 * `completedAt: null` is durable evidence of an interrupted destroy. Then one
 * transaction stamps the marker on the circulation, and the pass is claimed on
 * the row itself.
 *
 * WHY THE MARKER AND THE CLAIM ARE SEPARATE WRITES. The claim lives on the
 * audit row (`claimDestroyAuditPass`, shared with the round destroy) and the
 * marker lives on the circulation, so they are two documents and there is a
 * gap between them. The gap is safe because the marker is the thing being
 * raced for: exactly one caller can stamp it, and everybody else takes the
 * resume path, where the claim is what refuses them. A caller that stamps the
 * marker and then dies before claiming leaves a resumable destroy with no
 * claim, which is precisely the state a resume expects to find.
 *
 * THE LOSER OF THE RACE CLOSES ITS OWN ROW. `openDestroyAudit` is not
 * transactional, so two admins pressing Destroy in the same instant both open
 * one. Only the winner's row is ever accumulated into, so the loser completes
 * its row rather than leaving a permanent "an interrupted destroy of this
 * exists" over a circulation nothing touched, and is then refused by the
 * winner's claim, which is the truth: a pass is running, it just is not
 * theirs.

 * Destroy one circulation. Admin only (enforced at the route). Resumable: the

 *
 *  0. The blockers (fresh destroys only), then the audit row and the marker
 *     (see beginCirculationDestroy). From this point an open row exists for
 *     anything that dies, and the circulation is closed and flagged, so the
 *     recipient's own surfaces refuse to write into it.
 *  1. REVIEWS, then RESPONSES. Reviews first because a review is staff writing
 *     ABOUT a response: with the response gone first, a crash between the two
 *     would leave notes and scores about somebody whose answers no longer
 *     exist, which is the one leftover here that is still personal data.
 *  2. TASKS, each through `recursiveDelete` with its attachment blobs. After
 *     the responses, because a task is the recipient's way IN to the response
 *     and a card pointing at nothing is the state to spend the least time in.
 *  3. SCHEDULER MARKERS. They carry no member work, but a `wsremind__` row
 *     outliving its circulation is not inert: it is a dedupe record, and a
 *     stale one can suppress a real send later.
 *  4. The two STORAGE FOLDERS: the recipients' uploaded answers, then the
 *     copy's own question images. After every document that names them, so a
 *     resume never has documents pointing at files that have gone.
 *  5. The CIRCULATION DOCUMENT last, with the audit row's completion. While it
 *     exists a resumed pass can find everything; deleting it is the write that
 *     makes the destroy final.
 *
 * The loop runs FULL PASSES until a pass deletes nothing, and the mandatory
 * zero-delete pass is the verification rather than a formality.
