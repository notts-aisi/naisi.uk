 * WHO MAY DO WHAT TO A CIRCULATION, in one place.
 *
 * There are five doors onto the same document (create, add recipients, submit,
 * upload, and everything wave 2 adds: return, unfreeze, export, aggregate,
 * close), and they ask two questions between them: "may this person send a
 * worksheet at all" and "is this person staff of THIS circulation". Written out
 * once per route those two predicates drift, and the drift is silent: a route
 * that tests the raw `permissions.circulateWorksheet` key forgets that admins
 * hold every key implicitly, and one that tests `senderUid == uid` forgets the
 * worksheet's author and the named reviewers, who are staff by the contract.
 *
 * `assertNotImpersonating()` is deliberately NOT called from here. It reads
 * cookies and builds a `NextResponse`, so a module every route imports would
 * drag `next/server` into places that have no request; and a guard that lives
 * inside a helper is a guard `tests/impersonation-guard.test.mjs` cannot see,
 * because that scan looks for the call at the TOP of each handler. Every
 * mutating route in this tree calls it itself, first, before anything here.

 * identical so every gate in the app agrees about what counts as addressable.
