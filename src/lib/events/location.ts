/**
 * WHAT AN EVENT'S LOCATION SAYS TO A PERSON, decided in one place.
 *
 * An event carries three fields: `location` (the exact room or address),
 * `locationHidden` (the organiser chose to keep it off every public surface)
 * and `locationPublicText` (the fuzzy label shown instead, "somewhere on
 * University Park"). Who may see the exact one is a single rule: a person
 * holding a CONFIRMED place. Everybody else, the public page, the events
 * list, the calendar file, the announcement, an attendee whose RSVP is
 * pending or waitlisted, sees the public label, and when the organiser left
 * that label empty they see a placeholder rather than the exact text.
 *
 * ── WHY ONE MODULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The rule lives in this one file and nowhere else. A rule that lives in one
 * file cannot disagree with itself, and `tests/event-location-disclosure
 * .test.mjs` walks the tree to keep every other file out of the decision.
 *
 * Isomorphic on purpose: no `server-only`, no Firestore import. The public
 * pages render it in a Server Component and the editor's preview in a Client
 * Component, and the emails reach it through server code.
