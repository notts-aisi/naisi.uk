/*
 * The server's read of a member's push switches.
 *
 * One helper, used by every mirror, so the three decisions below are made
 * once rather than per caller.
 *
 * ABSENT IS THE DEFAULT, NOT A REFUSAL, for the opt-out rows.
 * `normaliseNotifications` resolves an unwritten `push` map to `courses` and
 * `tasks` on, which is what keeps today's task and decision mirrors working
 * for every member who has enabled a device and never visited the switches.
 * The `newsletter` and `events` rows are opt-in and resolve off, because a
 * switch nobody has seen is not consent.
 *
 * A MISSING USER DOC RESOLVES THE ROW'S DEFAULT, the same answer an absent
 * cell gets: yes on `courses` and `tasks`, no on `newsletter` and `events`.
 * A sender that enumerates DEVICES (the event announcement, and any producer
 * built the same way) reaches this branch for every device row whose owner's
 * document is gone, and an opt-in row's notification must not reach somebody
 * who never opted in. So the branch goes through `resolveRow` like every other
 * absent answer, and the table in docs/notifications.md has one rule for the
 * whole column.
 *
 * A FAILED READ IS A NO. If Firestore cannot answer, we do not know whether
 * this member opted out, and the cost of the two answers is not symmetric: a
 * dropped push loses nothing (the email that it mirrors is still sent),
 * while a push to somebody who switched them off is the one thing this
 * preference exists to prevent. So the error path fails closed and says so
 * in the log.
