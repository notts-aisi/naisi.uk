/**
 * THE WEEKLY COHORT NUDGE — template resolution, token building, rendering, the
 * send-dedupe marker id, and the one-recipient send. The route at
 * `/api/courses/runs/[runId]/nudge` decides WHO gets it and WHEN; this module
 * owns WHAT lands in the inbox and WHAT COUNTS AS "already sent".
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONLY IMPLEMENTATION. The route resolves the template through
 * `resolveCourseNudgeTemplate`, renders through `renderCourseNudge`, and sends
 * through `sendCourseWeekNudgeEmail`; it builds no tokens, escapes no HTML and
 * writes no unsubscribe markup of its own. The admin designer's preview and its
 * test send route through `renderCourseNudge` too, so an admin proofing the copy
 * sees the same degradation rules a recipient gets. Adding a second renderer
 * anywhere is how "Your group meets {sessionWhen}, {sessionWhere}." reaches a
 * cohort.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A PREPARED SEND, NOT A SCHEDULED ONE ────────────────────────
 * App Hosting gives us no scheduler (see `weekPlan.ts`: nothing is ever
 * "advanced", the current week is a pure function of `(run, now)`), so a nudge
 * CANNOT FIRE ITSELF. The shipped shape is therefore a prepared, human-
 * triggered send: a facilitator or admin opens the run, sees this week's nudge
 * pre-filled from the template below, and sends it with one click.
 *
 * The important part is what that shape leaves room for. The send route is
 * IDEMPOTENT PER (run, CALENDAR SLOT): the position in the run is recomputed
 * server-side from `currentWeekFor(run, now)` — never taken from the caller —
 * and the send is claimed against a deterministic marker doc in `courseNudges`
 * (`nudgeMarkerId`, below) before any mail moves, with a marker anywhere in the
 * ±6-day span around that slot counting as the same week (`nudgeWeekMarkerIds`,
 * whose header says why the slot id alone is not enough). So the same endpoint can later
 * be handed to Cloud Scheduler or a GitHub Action on a daily cron and it will
 * send EXACTLY ONCE PER COHORT WEEK with no code change: six no-op calls and one
 * real send per week, whichever day the cron happens to run, and a human press
 * on the same day is absorbed by the same marker. Nothing here builds that
 * scheduler — it just refuses to make it a rewrite. Anything added to this
 * module must stay safe to call twice.
 *
 * ── ADMIN-EDITABLE COPY, FALLBACK-FIRST ────────────────────────────────────
 * The body is `courseEmailTemplates/course-week-nudge`, edited in Admin → Email
 * designs → Course emails, exactly like the five lifecycle templates. Nothing
 * seeds that doc: `resolveCourseNudgeTemplate` falls back to
 * `courseTemplateDefaults` when it is missing, malformed, or empty, so a fresh
 * deploy sends sensible copy before anyone opens the editor, and a Firestore
 * read failure degrades to the defaults rather than to silence.
 *
 * ── THE ANNOUNCEMENT LANE: THIS MAIL IS OPT-OUTABLE ────────────────────────
 * A nudge is not "your room moved" — it is a weekly announcement, so it carries
 * the same unsubscribe affordance as the cohort broadcast: a visible footer link
 * (`CourseNudgeEmail`) plus the RFC 8058 `List-Unsubscribe` headers, both
 * pointing at one signed token scoped to `cohort:<runId>`. The route owns the
 * rest of that lane (subscription ∩ active enrolment, the `courses` category
 * opt-out, suppression); see `/api/courses/runs/[runId]/email/route.ts`, whose
 * audience rules this send reuses verbatim.
 *
 * ── TOKEN VALUES ARE FACILITATOR-AUTHORED. THEY GO IN AS TEXT. ─────────────
 * The week title, the summary and the group's room name are typed by
 * facilitators in the week/group editors — they are DATA, not markup. Every
 * value is HTML-escaped before it is substituted into a `richText` block, and
 * collapsed to a single line first (so a multi-line summary cannot inject a
 * header break into a subject either). The nudge renders through its own pass
 * below, never through `personaliseBlocks` in newsletterBlocks.ts. Adding a
 * token means adding it to `CourseNudgeTokens` and nowhere else; the escaping
 * is applied by the renderer, not per token.
 *
 * ── GRACEFUL DEGRADATION IS A HARD REQUIREMENT, NOT POLISH ─────────────────
 * A member must never receive "Your group meets ." or a literal `{sessionWhen}`
 * or the word "undefined". The other course templates take the opposite line —
 * an unresolved token stays literal so an ADMIN notices — and that convention is
 * right for a decision email an admin proofs and wrong here, because the nudge
 * goes to a whole cohort on data a facilitator may simply not have filled in
 * yet. So the renderer guarantees three things:
 *
 *  1. Every token in `CourseNudgeTokens` always has a string value. Absent is
 *     `""`, never `undefined`, so nothing can print "undefined".
 *  2. A text unit — a heading, or one `<p>` inside a rich-text block — that
 *     references at least one token and whose tokens ALL resolved to empty is
 *     DROPPED WHOLE. That is what removes the sentence rather than leaving its
 *     scaffolding behind. It is an exact rule, not a heuristic: units with no
 *     tokens are never dropped, and a unit that resolved anything is kept.
 *  3. What survives goes through a punctuation tidy (`tidyText`) that closes up
 *     the mixed case, where one token in a sentence resolved and another did
 *     not: "18:00, ." becomes "18:00.", an emptied `<strong></strong>` is
 *     removed so the punctuation either side can meet, and an anchor whose href
 *     resolved to nothing is unwrapped to plain text rather than shipped dead.
 *
 * COPY RULE THAT FALLS OUT OF (2), and the seed template obeys it: KEEP EACH
 * OPTIONAL TOKEN IN ITS OWN PARAGRAPH, in plain text rather than inside a bold
 * or link tag. Two optional tokens may share a paragraph only when they are
 * comma-joined, and `buildCourseNudgeTokens` enforces the one pairing that
 * matters — `sessionWhere` is blanked whenever `sessionWhen` is empty, because
 * "meets, Hallward B12" is the one dangling sentence the tidy pass cannot fix.
 *
 * ── VOICE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Plain, warm, brief, active, sentence case. No marketing tone, no exclamation
 * marks, no emoji. It says what is happening and what the reader might do. It
 * NEVER implies the reader is behind, because it has no idea whether they are —
 * and a busy student who opted into something they care about does not need to
 * be chased. Copy edits should keep that; the defaults below are the reference.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The send-dedupe marker
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The id of the document that says "this cohort has had its nudge for this
 * stretch of calendar". `.create()` at this deterministic id IS the
 * once-per-cohort-week guarantee — the same structural trick the task mirror
 * uses — and it is claimed BEFORE the first message goes out, never after.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS KEYED ON THE SLOT, NOT ON THE DISPLAY WEEK NUMBER ────────────
 * `slotStartKey` is the civil date the cohort's current 7-day slot began:
 * `startDate + floor(daysElapsed / 7) * 7`. It is a pure function of the run's
 * START DATE and the clock, and — unlike `weekNumber` — it does not consult
 * `weekPlan` at all. Renumbering a plan therefore cannot move a slot that has
 * already started, so the marker claimed for a slot is still the marker
 * consulted for it later in the same week.
 *
 * ── WHY ONE ID IS NOT ENOUGH: `startDate` MOVES THE SLOT ITSELF ────────────
 * Changing a run's `startDate` mints a DIFFERENT key for the same calendar
 * week.
 *
 * So "already sent for this week" is not one id but a SPAN.
 * `nudgeWeekMarkerIds` below lists this slot's id plus the twelve within ±6
 * days, and the route treats a marker at ANY of them as this calendar week's
 * nudge. Seven days out is genuinely the next week and is deliberately outside
 * the span.
 *
 * THE COST, TAKEN DELIBERATELY: moving `startDate` BACKWARDS by 1-6 days puts
 * the FOLLOWING week's slot inside the previous marker's span, so that one
 * week's nudge is suppressed until an admin forces it. That is the same trade
 * the send ordering makes — a missed nudge is a nudge, a duplicate blast is an
 * incident — and it is visible rather than silent, because the preview reports
 * the matched marker's claim time.
 *
 * `.create()` at the deterministic id REMAINS the guarantee: two ticks racing
 * inside one slot still aim at one document. The span check is a read in front
 * of it and cannot be atomic — which is the right shape, because what it
 * defends against is a human editing a run, not a race.
 *
 * Markers live in `courseNudges`, which firestore.rules locks `read, write: if
 * false` as server-side course-email bookkeeping. The collection is shared with
 * the P9 send throttle, which prefixes its docs `emailrate__`; ours are `nudge__`.
 *
 * CONSTRUCT-ONLY — never parsed. `runId`, `slotStartKey`, `weekNumber` and
 * `weekId` are all stored as fields on the document.

 * prefix so the two families cannot collide in a collection they share with

 *
 * ── THE OCCURRENCE IS PART OF THE KEY ───────────────────────────────────────

 * The per-week virtual/in-person switch is the facilitator SAYING which

 * carry — which is the whole reason it exists. A group with a standing room
 * that meets online for one week has a non-empty `location`, and reading it
 * here mailed the cohort a room on the night nobody was in it. So:
 *
 *   · `"virtual"`   → "Online", whatever the room says. (Never the URL — see
 *                     above; the link is one click away on the week page.)
 *   · `"in-person"` → the room, and NEVER the "Online" fallback: a group with
 *                     a permanent meet link would otherwise be told "Online"
 *                     for a week their facilitator explicitly put in a room.
 *                     No room stored → "", which drops the sentence rather

 *   · `null`        → the legacy resolution, unchanged.
 *
 * ── A ROOM IS TYPED BY A PERSON, AND A LINK CAN BE TYPED INTO ONE ───────────
 * So the room is asked about before it is printed (`couldBeFollowed`, the one
 * function the placement email asks too, so the two cannot come to differ).
 * A room with anything in it that a reader could follow is not printed: the
 * answer is "", exactly as for a group with no room, and the sentence closes
 * up around it. The email's own link to the week's page is where that group's
 * people find where they meet. It is never turned into "Online": a room that
 * holds a link may still be a room.
 *
