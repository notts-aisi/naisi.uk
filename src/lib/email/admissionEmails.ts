/**
 * ADMISSIONS lifecycle mail: the applicant's own receipts on an admission
 * round, the weekly-questions announcement, and the appointment round's two
 * decisions. Six sends today, one per template id, and the rest of the
 * round's lifecycle (the enrolment decisions) lands on this module as those
 * routes are built.
 *
 * Four of the six are fired by somebody's own action, the applicant's or the
 * decider's, and two, the deadline reminder and the stage announcement, are
 * fired by the scheduler tick.
 * That difference is why this function returns an outcome (see
 * `AdmissionSendOutcome`): a claimed marker has to know whether the send
 * actually happened.
 *
 * ## Why it is not `courseApplicationEmails.ts`
 *
 * That module's whole contract is stated in terms of a RUN: its options are
 * `courseTitle` / `runLabel` / `startDate`, it logs as `course-application`,
 * and its comment is a set of promises about what a decision email may claim
 * about a group and a first session. An admission round has none of those. One
 * round feeds several runs and an appointment round feeds none, so folding
 * these in would have made every one of those sentences conditionally true and
 * left `{courseTitle}` resolving to something arbitrary in an applicant's
 * inbox.
 *
 * ## Template resolution is FALLBACK-FIRST
 *
 * A stored `courseEmailTemplates/{id}` doc wins only when it is well-formed and
 * non-empty, so an admin who saves a blank body still sends the seed copy, and
 * a Firestore read failure degrades to the defaults rather than to silence.
 * Same discipline as both sibling modules, and it matters more here: there is
 * no seed step, so "no doc" is the normal state on a fresh backend.
 *
 * ## Suppression is checked here, and this function never throws
 *
 * `sendEmail` now consults the suppression list itself and holds a suppressed
 * recipient (logging a `suppressed` row), so this check is belt and braces: it
 * skips the address before a message is even built, and it is what
 * `tests/funnel-harness-guards.test.mjs` reads. A suppressed address is
 * skipped silently.
 *
 * Every call site fires this AFTER its transaction has committed, and a
 * confirmation is a courtesy rather than part of the write, so the whole body
 * sits in a try/catch and the caller cannot tell a send from a skip from a
 * failure. That is the `sendRsvpEmail` posture, chosen for the same reason: an
 * SMTP hiccup must never turn a saved application into a 500 the applicant
 * reads as "it did not go through".
 */

/**
 * `declined` is the APPOINTMENT round's refusal: we cannot take you on as a
 * facilitator. The ENROLMENT round's refusal is a different send about a
 * different thing (a place on a course rather than a role running one) and it
 * arrives with the enrolment decide path under its own kind and its own
 * template id. Naming this one `rejected` would have taken that id.

 * both places. The SCHEDULER cannot walk away. It holds a marker it claimed
 * before the send, and stamping `sentAt` on a send that threw would be
 * permanent silent non-delivery: every later tick would re-derive the same
 * reminder, find a stamped marker, and skip. So the outcome comes back, and
 * the tick stamps `sentAt` only on `sent`, leaves the marker unstamped on
 * `failed` (which is what the re-claim rule exists to pick up), and settles it
 * as skipped on `suppressed`.
 *

/**
 * The tokens each TRIGGER actually supplies, and the list is per kind rather
 * than per helper on purpose.
 *
 * `AdmissionEmailOptions` describes what this function CAN be passed; a call
 * site decides what it DOES pass, and the two are not the same list. The
 * reinstate branch of `POST .../apply` sends no `decisionsBy` and no
 * `stageLabel`, so seed copy or an admin's rewrite using `{decisionsBy}` would
 * arrive as those nine literal characters in somebody's inbox, and a test that
 * asked the helper what it supports would have called that fine.
 *
 * So the map is the contract, the filter below enforces it, and
 * `tests/admissions-status-hub.test.mjs` checks each template's copy against
 * its own kind's set. A trigger that starts supplying a token adds it here in
 * the same commit as the call site.
 *
 * The three COURSE tokens are absent from every entry but `appointed`, which
 * is what drops them: a round is not a run, so `{courseTitle}` stays literal
 * rather than resolving to a blank and cutting a hole in a sentence. They ARE
 * present on `appointed`, and that is not an inconsistency: an appointment
 * names a run, because it writes the person onto one. It is the one admissions
 * send that knows a course.
 *
 * `appointed` may therefore resolve all three to whatever the run says, blank
 * included, and nothing here re-checks that. The decide route is where an
 * appointment onto a run with no start date is refused, so by the time this
 * function is called the date exists. A second guard here would have been a
 * filter quietly rescuing a decision the route should not have let through.
 *
 * `declined` carries NO `reason` token, and its absence is the point.
 * `AdmissionsDeclinedEmail` renders the decider's shared note as its own
 * paragraph, so a `{reason}` in the body would print the same sentence a
 * second time. The share gate lives on the prop; the token set does not
 * duplicate it.
