/**
 * Shared confirmation logic for the uni-email magic link. Called both by the
 * `/api/verify-email/confirm` route (client-side POST path, used by other
 * consumers) and directly from the `/verify-email/[tokenId]` server component
 * (no internal HTTP roundtrip).
 *
 * OWNERSHIP BINDING (`callerUid`). Confirming a uni-email link marks the
 * `authUid` recorded on the token as the verified owner of that address — it
 * stamps `users/{authUid}.profile.uniEmailVerifiedAt` and closes the address
 * against every other account (`findVerifiedUniEmailOwner`). The token binds to
 * the uid of the account that requested the link, not to whoever ends up
 * clicking. Uni-email verification is an attribute proof on an
 * ALREADY-SIGNED-IN account (unlike the login-email magic link, which mints a
 * session and is cross-device by design), so the confirming request must be
 * authenticated as `authUid`. `callerUid` is the uid the confirming request
 * resolves (`null` when signed out); a mismatch is refused before `verifiedAt`
 * is flipped or the user doc is stamped. Guard: tests/uni-email-ownership.test.mjs.
