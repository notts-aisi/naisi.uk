 * `sendEmail`, and the suppression list is consulted HERE rather than in each
 * feature's own helper, so no caller has to remember it. The per-feature
 * checks stay where they are: they are harmless duplicates, and several of
 * them save rendering an email nobody will read.
 *
 * A suppressed recipient is DROPPED, not failed: the caller asked for a
 * message to be sent and the answer is that this address is not sendable,
 * which is not an error in the caller's work. It leaves an `emailSends` row at
 * status `suppressed` carrying the same kind, subject, reference and actor the
 * send would have carried, so the deliverability tab answers "what did we
 * withhold, from whom, and why" rather than showing a silent gap.
