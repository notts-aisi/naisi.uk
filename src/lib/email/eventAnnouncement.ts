/**
 * "WE HAVE PUBLISHED A NEW EVENT": the sender the `events` row was promising.
 *
 * The notification grid's events row has been collected on /register and
 * /profile since the subscriptions junction landed, and its copy promises "a
 * short email when we publish a new event". Nothing read it. A row that
 * promises a message nothing sends is worse than no row: it takes a real answer
 * from a member and does nothing with it. This is that message.
 *
 * ── IT IS THE GRID CLASS, ON BOTH COLUMNS, AND THEY ARE TWO ANSWERS ─────────
 * EMAIL goes to the `subscriptions` junction, exactly as the newsletter's does:
 * every confirmed-and-subscribed row on channel `events`, hydrated per member
 * through `addressesForSend`, which applies the events cell AND the per-address
 * gmail/uniEmail routing in one answer. The junction row IS the opt-in here,
 * which is why there is no second check: a row exists because somebody asked
 * for it, and `addressesForSend` returns an empty list for anybody whose cell
 * has since gone off.
 *
 * PUSH goes to the events PUSH cell, which is a different answer to a different
 * question and is opt-in (absent resolves OFF, see `resolveRow`). So the push
 * audience is not derived from the junction at all: it is every account with a
 * device whose `push.events` cell is on. A member can hold the email row and
 * refuse the push, or hold neither, or hold only the push, and all three are
 * respected because each column is asked separately.
 *
 * ── MEMBERS-ONLY EVENTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An event with `visibility: "members"` is not public, so a GUEST row on the
 * events channel (an address with no account, from the public subscribe form)
 * must not hear about it. Those rows are dropped and counted. User rows are
 * kept: they belong to accounts, which is the same bar the event page applies.
 * The push audience is accounts by construction, so it needs no equivalent
 * filter.
 *
 * ── IT MUST NEVER FAIL A PUBLISH ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The caller publishes the event first and calls this afterwards. Everything
 * here is best effort and returns COUNTS: a channel that cannot be read, a
 * render that throws, a push service having a bad day. An event that went live
 * and did not get announced is a missing email; an announcement that turned a
 * publish into a 500 would be an event nobody can find on a page that says it
 * failed to save.
 */

/**
 * Sanity ceiling on the channel READ, which bounds the hydration behind it: one
 * `getAll` over the user rows. Over it the announcement is REFUSED before a
 * document is fetched. It is not the send ceiling; that is the next constant,
 * and it is counted on a different thing.
 */

/**
 * THE SEND CEILING, COUNTED IN MESSAGES AND NOT IN JUNCTION ROWS.
 *
 * A row is not a message. A member with a verified university address on both
 * channels takes TWO sends, so a 500-row list is up to a thousand `sendEmail`
 * calls, and this whole announcement runs inside the publish REQUEST, against
 * `apphosting.yaml`'s `timeoutSeconds: 60`. `dispatch.ts` carries the
 * arithmetic; the figure it supports is 200 messages, the same number the run
 * composer's cap was sized to: ceil(200/6) = 34 rounds x 1.05s worst = ~36s,
 * ~19s typical.
 *
 * Counted AFTER hydration, on addresses, because that is the only count that is
 * the number of sends. A request over it is REFUSED, and refused loudly enough
 * that the publish route can hand the claim back (see its header): a truncation
 * would mail an arbitrary prefix of the list and report success, and a timeout
 * would do the same with no report at all.
 *
 * RAISING IT MEANS REDOING THE SUM IN `dispatch.ts`. A list that outgrows it
 * is sent by the `event-announcements` scheduler job instead, which is the
 * feature that took the send off the request path; see
 * {@link MAX_QUEUED_ANNOUNCEMENT_ROWS}.

/**
 * The JOB PATH's ceiling on the same channel read, and the reason it is ten

 *
 * There is no message ceiling on the job path at all, and that is the whole
 * point of the move: the job's unit of work is one recipient under one marker,
 * it checks the tick's wall clock between units, and it resumes on the next
 * tick, reading its markers in bulk so a settled recipient costs a set lookup
 * rather than three round trips. A list up to THIS ceiling therefore goes out,
 * over as many ticks as it takes. Not a list of any size: the ceiling below is
 * the bound, and it is on the READ rather than on the sending.
 *
 * What survives is a sanity ceiling on the junction READ, because that read is
 * NOT paged: `findRecipientsForChannel` fetches every confirmed-and-subscribed
 * row on the channel in one go, and the `getAll` over the user rows behind it
 * is proportional to the result. 5000 rows is far above any shape this society
 * plans and comfortably inside one Firestore read, and a list past it is
 * REFUSED whole rather than truncated, exactly as the request path refuses:
 * an arbitrary prefix that reports success is the one outcome a retry cannot
 * repair. Paging the read is the fix if the list ever genuinely approaches it,
 * and it would need a stable order to page on, which the junction has no index
 * for today.
