/**
 * The send-side machinery for COHORT- AND GROUP-ADDRESSED course mail — the two
 * P9 email routes (`/api/courses/groups/[groupId]/email`,
 * `/api/courses/runs/[runId]/email`) and P11's weekly nudge
 * (`/api/courses/runs/[runId]/nudge`). Templates, payload validation, the
 * durable send throttle, the run-staff gate and the cohort audience derivation
 * live together because the routes must agree on all of them; route handlers
 * don't import from one another by house convention, so this module is where
 * they meet.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY SEND AND WHO RECEIVES ARE DEFINED ONCE, HERE ────────────────────
 * `gateRunStaff` and `resolveCohortAudience` were previously written out twice,
 * line for line, in the announcement route and the nudge route — with a comment
 * in each saying "IF YOU CHANGE ONE, CHANGE BOTH". They are the same predicate
 * and the same audience by design (a nudge IS an announcement to the whole run),
 * so they are now one function each and the comment is retired. The extraction
 * was a pure move: both routes' status codes, refusal sentences, `skipped`
 * arithmetic, log tags and read ordering are unchanged.
 *
 * Sits beside `courseApplicationEmails.ts` and takes the same shape (a thin,
 * typed wrapper over `sendEmail` that renders through the shared chrome), with
 * one decisive difference: application mail renders ADMIN-AUTHORED BLOCKS from
 * `courseEmailTemplates`, whereas everything here renders a facilitator's
 * free-typed plain text arriving in a REQUEST BODY.
 *
 * ── THE BODY IS TEXT. IT IS NEVER HTML. ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `BlockRenderer` renders a `richText` block with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`,
 * because newsletter blocks are TipTap output from a permissioned drafter that
 * an admin approves before it sends. A course email has neither property: any
 * facilitator can type into it and it goes out unreviewed. So `bodyToBlocks`
 * ESCAPES the text and builds the markup itself — the only HTML that reaches a
 * richText block from here is the `<p>`/`<br />` skeleton this file writes.
 * Nothing in a request body is ever concatenated into markup unescaped. If you
 * add a field to these templates, escape it the same way or render it through a
 * React child (which escapes by construction).
 *
 * ── FROM-NAME IS DELIBERATELY NOT OVERRIDDEN ────────────────────────────────
 * `sendEmail` falls back to `SMTP_FROM_NAME` when no `fromName` is passed.
 * Passing a fixed `fromName` here (e.g. "NAISI Courses", as the events routes
 * do) would take precedence over that setting. Don't.
 *
 * ── REPLY-TO IS THE ORG INBOX, NOT THE SENDER ───────────────────────────────
 * No `replyTo` is passed, so `EMAIL_DEFAULT_REPLY_TO` applies. Setting it to
 * the facilitator's address would hand every member of the group their
 * facilitator's personal email — the exact disclosure the PII-free roster
 * exists to prevent. The sender is named (names only) in the signature line.

 * HOW MANY OF THIS RUN'S ACTIVE MEMBERS A COHORT SEND CANNOT REACH.

 * `resolveCohortAudience` is the subscription channel INTERSECTED with active
 * enrolments, and that first half is deliberate: the unsubscribe link in an
 * announcement flips the row, so an enrolment-derived audience would re-mail
 * everyone who clicked it. The consequence is that a member who unsubscribed is
 * not in the audience, is not in `skipped`, and leaves no trace in the report at
 * all: the sender reads "sent to 24" and cannot tell whether the cohort is 24
 * or 30.
 *
 * That is a gap the notice lane feels hardest, because its whole promise is
 * reach, so this counts the gap and the composer prints it. It does NOT close
 * it: widening the notice lane's audience past an unsubscribe is a consent
 * decision, not a defect fix, and it belongs to whoever owns the consent story
 * rather than to this function.
 *
 * TWO READS. The unsubscribed rows on the channel (equality-only, no index
 * owed), then one addressed `getAll` over their deterministic enrolment ids,
 * because the rows also include people who LEFT the run (the remove route
 * unsubscribes them), and reporting those as unreachable members would be a
 * different wrong number.

 * reads a line saying why it reached them whatever their settings.
 *
 * ── EXCEPT THE REHEARSAL, WHICH IS NOT ONE ──────────────────────────────────
 * `test: true` reaches the sender's own address and nobody else, which makes it
 * a diagnostic rather than a notice: nobody's preference was bypassed, and the
 * deliverability tab has to keep telling a rehearsal apart from the send it
 * rehearses. So the test lane keeps `sendEmail` and keeps `kind: "course-test"`,
