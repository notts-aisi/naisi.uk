/**
 * THE NOTICE LANE'S CAPS.
 *
 * A notice reaches its audience whatever their notification grid says, so the
 * usual backstop is gone: nobody on the receiving end can turn the volume down.
 * The volume is therefore bounded on the sending side, and it is bounded
 * DURABLY, in Firestore, for the reason `reserveSendSlot` already gives in
 * `courseFacilitatorEmails.ts`: what is being capped is real mail to real
 * members.
 *
 * ── THE SHAPE IS THE ROOM NOTICE'S, DELIBERATELY ────────────────────────────
 * Same collection (`courseNudges`), same `emailrate__` doc-id prefix, same
 * document fields, same claim-then-count discipline: the slot is spent when the
 * send is ATTEMPTED, not when it succeeds, because a request that dies half way
 * through a forty-person dispatch has already delivered part of the mail and
 * its retry has to be rationed like any other send. Fail closed is the only
 * safe direction for a throttle on outbound mail.
 *
 * The collection name is course-flavoured for historical reasons (the course
 * email routes needed a durable counter first) and it is the key PREFIX, not
 * the collection, that separates the lanes. Reusing it is what lets
 * every existing counter carry on counting: the group email route and the run
 * composer pass the SAME keys they passed to `reserveSendSlot`, so a facilitator
 * who has sent two emails this hour still has one slot, not three.
 * `firestore.rules` locks `courseNudges` to `read, write: if false` as
 * server-side email bookkeeping.
 *
 * ── TWO WINDOWS, ONE TRANSACTION ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The lane's caps are 3 an hour per (sender, audience) and 10 a day per
 * audience: the first stops one person's runaway composer, the second stops an
 * audience being mailed ten times by five different people. Claiming them in
 * two separate transactions would spend the hour slot on a send the day cap
 * then refuses, so both are read and both are written inside ONE transaction,
 * and a refusal on either leaves both counters untouched. Firestore wants every
 * read before every write, which is what the two-phase body below is.
 *
 * Either window may be omitted. The room notice omits the hourly one on
 * purpose: v2 decision 8 requires that lane to survive the evening where the
 * room changes twice and the mode flips once, and its 10-a-day per-group
 * counter is the cap that decision pinned. An omitted window is stated at the
 * call site, never defaulted here.
 *
 * ── AND A REFUSAL, NEVER A TRUNCATION ───────────────────────────────────────
 * {@link MAX_NOTICE_RECIPIENTS} is a ceiling the whole request FAILS against.
 * A partial send is the worst outcome available to this feature because it
 * looks successful: an arbitrary three hundred get the mail, the report says
 * three hundred sent and none skipped, and the retry re-mails the same three
 * hundred. Lanes with a TIGHTER ceiling of their own keep it (the group routes
 * refuse over 100, the cohort resolver over 200); this is the lane's outer
 * bound, not a licence to raise theirs.
