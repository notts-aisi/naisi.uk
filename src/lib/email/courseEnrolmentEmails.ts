/**
 * ENROLMENT lifecycle mail, as opposed to the ADMISSIONS lifecycle mail in
 * `courseApplicationEmails.ts`. One template today: the confirmation somebody
 * gets after dropping themselves out of a course.
 *
 * Same resolution discipline as its sibling and for the same reasons:
 * FALLBACK-FIRST (a stored `courseEmailTemplates/{id}` doc wins only when it
 * is well-formed and non-empty, so an admin who saves a blank body still
 * sends the seed copy), and a Firestore read failure degrades to the defaults
 * rather than to silence.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `sendCourseApplicationEmail`'s whole contract is stated in terms of an
 * application: its kinds are `submitted` / `accepted` / `waitlisted` /
 * `rejected` / `allocated`, it logs as `course-application`, and its module
 * comment is a set of promises about what a decision email may and may not
 * claim. An open-enrolment run has no application anywhere in it. Bolting a
 * sixth kind onto that module would have made every one of those sentences
 * conditionally true.
 *
 * ── SUPPRESSION IS CHECKED HERE, NOT LEFT TO THE TRANSPORT ──────────────────
 * `sendEmail` now consults the suppression list itself, so this is belt and
 * braces that also skips the render. This mail
 * is transactional and the recipient is owed it, but "owed" does not survive a
 * hard bounce or a spam complaint: continuing to mail a suppressed address is
 * how a sending domain's reputation goes, and the drop-out has already
 * committed, so skipping the confirmation costs the member nothing they can
 * act on. A suppressed address is skipped silently, which the caller cannot
 * distinguish from a send, and must not need to.
