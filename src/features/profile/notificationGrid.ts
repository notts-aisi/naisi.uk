 * cannot see, and one that writes a third value instead of the cells is a
 * preference nothing reads), and `npm test` has no DOM. So the rules live in
 * this module and the component draws them.

 * beside the resolver every sender reads. This file adds only what is true of
 * the GRID: what a master switch means over an email column whose two
 * subscription rows expand per address, and when the push column is dead
 * because of the browser rather than the account.
