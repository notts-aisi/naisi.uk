/**
 * Server-only fetcher for the round a course's public page speaks about
 * (`fetchCourses.ts` pattern, and the same standing obligation).
 *
 * ## The obligation, restated because this file inherits it
 *
 * `admissionRounds` is `allow read, write: if false`, read:false as well,
 * because the doc carries live `applicationCounts`, the `finalDeciderUid` who
 * decides your application, and the `criteria` reviewers score against. This
 * reads through the Admin SDK, so rules provide no defence here at all.
 * VISIBILITY IS THIS FILE'S TO ENFORCE, and it does it by PROJECTION rather
 * than by discipline: the return type below carries five fields, all of them
 * dates or a state, and there is no path by which a whole `AdmissionRoundDoc`
 * reaches a renderer. A future field added to the round document is therefore
 * private by default, which is the correct default for this collection.
 *
 * The round's own `label` is deliberately NOT among them. It is the
 * admin-facing handle ("autumn intake v2 DO NOT OPEN"), the same class of
 * string as `courseRuns.label` that V3 stopped showing visitors.
 *
 * That is a smaller claim than "the label never reaches a visitor", which
 * would be false: a round's doc id is `slugId(label)`, so a slugified copy of
 * whatever an admin typed is already in the `/apply/[roundId]` URL this page
 * links to. What this projection guarantees is that no surface PRINTS the
 * label as prose, which is where an admin handle reads as copy. The round
 * console's Name field says so where it is typed, because the discipline that
 * keeps the URL respectable lives there rather than here.
 *
 * ## Why the query is backwards
 *
 * `courseRuns.admissionRoundIds` (the forward pointer) does not exist yet, so
 * the join is walked from the round: `outcomeRunIds` array-contains-any the
 * course's run ids. `array-contains-any` is a single-field index Firestore
 * provisions automatically, so this needs no composite index, and the site
 * runs a handful of rounds a year over a handful of runs per course.
