/**
 * The roster-reading mount of the section above, and the whole point of the

 *
 * `useMembers` LISTS `users`, which firestore.rules opens to admins and
 * SU-recognised committee only. /admin/courses is gated wider than that: a
 * `draftCourse` or `approveCourse` holder who is a plain member reaches this
 * editor, and while the hook was called from RunEditor itself their browser
 * fired that denied list on every load of the page. The cost was not just the
 * console error: the facilitator and role pickers came back empty, with
 * nothing on screen to tell them apart from a run that genuinely has nobody
 * on it. Mounting the hook in a child only the admitted viewers render is how
 * RoundEditor's RolesSection solves the same problem, and it is the shape to
 * copy the next time a course surface needs the roster.
 *
 * Hoisting this call back into RunEditor turns `tests/roster-read-gates.test.mjs`
 * red rather than turning the pickers quietly empty, which is the whole reason
 * that guard exists: this is the second time the mistake has been made by hand.
