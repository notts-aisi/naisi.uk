/**
 * The group-allocation board for one course run.
 *
 * ── THE INVARIANT THIS SCREEN EXISTS TO MAKE VISIBLE ────────────────────────
 * A member's placement is ONE scalar (`courseEnrolments/{runId}__{uid}.groupId`)
 * on a doc whose id is derived from (run, uid). Double placement is not
 * "prevented" here — it is unrepresentable. Consequently:
 *
 *   - a group's membership is always a QUERY (`people.filter(p => p.groupId ===
 *     g.id)`), never a `memberUids` array, and nothing in this file may
 *     introduce one;
 *   - a "move" is one write, not a remove-then-add, so there is no window in
 *     which someone is in two groups or in none;
 *   - "everyone placed" is a count of `groupId == null`, which is why the
 *     status rail can state it as fact rather than as a reassurance.
 *
 * The rail says so out loud once the pool empties, because the whole point of
 * choosing the data model this way is lost if the person doing the allocation
 * still has to check by hand.
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ── PII ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * NAME-ONLY. The payload carries no email addresses (see the route), and this
 * component builds no address from anything — no mailto, no uid-to-user read.
 * Track leads and facilitators are ordinary members; handing them a cohort's
 * addresses is not something anybody consented to. Reviewer notes and answers
 * are member-authored and are rendered as TEXT NODES only.
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ── DRAG IS THE GARNISH, NOT THE MECHANISM ─────────────────────────────────
 * Every card carries a "Move to…" menu, and bulk mode moves a selection in one
 * transaction. Drag-and-drop is a third path over the same `place()` call.
 * That ordering is deliberate: allocation happens on a laptop at a table, on a
 * phone on a train, and with a keyboard, and a board that can only be operated
 * by dragging is a board that half the committee cannot use. The dnd path
 * therefore ships with a `KeyboardSensor` + `sortableKeyboardCoordinates` and
 * a full `announcements` config — correctness, not polish.
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 *
