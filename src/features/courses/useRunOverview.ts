/**
 * Everything the run home and the week pages need about one run:
 * `GET /api/courses/runs/[runId]/overview` — the run and its week plan, the
 * computed current week, the published week index, the caller's own enrolment,
 * every group they hold (their placement and each group they facilitate),
 * their own attendance, and the `access` flags the `[runId]` layout gates on.
 *
 * EVERY GROUP CARRIES ITS OWN CALENDAR (`OverviewGroup.calendar`), and a
 * consumer drawing a group must read that rather than the payload's top-level
 * `currentWeek`. The top-level fields are resolved through the caller's OWN
 * group, which for a facilitator holding two is neither of them: the run's.
 * `group` (singular) is deprecated and null in exactly that case.
 *
 * One-shot with a manual refresh, same argument as `useMyRuns`: the payload
 * joins `courseRuns` + its `weeks` subcollection + `courseEnrolments` +
 * `courseGroups`, three of which the client cannot read directly, and the
 * current week is recomputed server-side per request rather than stored. The
 * one thing on these pages that DOES move under the reader — the member's own
 * check-offs — is live via `useRunProgress`.
 *
 * `access` is a mirror of the server's decision, never the decision itself:
 * the layout and every route re-derive it. Rendering a facilitator panel off a
 * tampered flag would show an empty panel, not someone else's data.
