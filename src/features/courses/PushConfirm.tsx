/**
 * The confirm in front of PUSH ATTENDANCE.
 *
 * Push is the only irreversible thing a facilitator can do on this page, and
 * it does three things at once, so the dialog names all three in the order
 * they matter to the person pressing it:
 *
 *   1. WHO GETS AN EMAIL. Named as a count of their own group, because that is
 *      what a facilitator can check against the room they were just in.
 *   2. THE REGISTER LOCKS. Said plainly, with the remedy: an admin can still
 *      correct it. A confirm that says "are you sure?" and nothing else teaches
 *      people to press through it.
 *   3. THE RECORD MOVES. Everyone's attendance figures are rebuilt from this
 *      register, which is what a reviewer will read months later.
 *
 * ── UNMARKED PEOPLE ARE THE THING WORTH INTERRUPTING FOR ────────────────────
 * A pushed register counts an unmarked person as absent, because the push is
 * the facilitator saying the register is finished. That is right, and it is
 * also the single easiest mistake to make on a busy evening, so the dialog
 * says how many are unmarked and what will happen to them, in their own
 * paragraph, before the button.
 *
 * ── A SESSION THAT DID NOT HAPPEN ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * When the held switch is off the copy changes completely: nobody is marked
 * absent, the session leaves every denominator, and the group still gets the
 * reminder about the next one. Same button, a different fact.
