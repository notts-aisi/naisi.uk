/**
 * The courses line on the dashboard, above My Work. Self-fetching, and
 * renders NOTHING until it has something worth saying — MyWorkSummary's
 * shape: a member with no live course sees no empty card, because a
 * dashboard full of "you have none of these" is worse than a short one.
 *
 * "Live" is narrower than the hub's list on purpose. The hub answers "every
 * run I touch, ever"; the dashboard answers "what is running now":
 *
 *   • membership — `enrolled` only. An OFFER is not a course in progress:
 *     there is no group, no week to be on and nowhere to go, so a row here
 *     would be a link to a redirect under a heading that says otherwise. The
 *     hub is where an offer is answered, in a card built to say it properly
 *     (RunCard). This test is explicit rather than left to the role filter
 *     below — an offer happens to carry no role today, and a summary that
 *     stayed honest only by accident is one field away from lying.
 *   • roles — learner or facilitator only. An admissions reviewer's run is a
 *     queue, not a course they are on, and it has no week to report.
 *   • status — no `completed` (history belongs on the hub), no `cancelled`,
 *     no `draft`.
 *   • archived — never. `courseRuns.archived` is the deletion protocol's soft
 *     path, and "drops out of members' live sections" is the promise the
 *     Danger zone makes in so many words; this card is the most live section
 *     there is. It is checked separately from `status` because the two are
 *     orthogonal (a run is archived at whatever point in its lifecycle it has
 *     reached), and a run mid-DESTROY carries the same flag — so this is also
 *     what keeps a cohort being deleted off the dashboard.
 *
 * A member whose only runs are finished — or whose only run is an offer not
 * yet allocated — therefore gets no card, which is the intended answer, not a
 * bug to fix by loosening the filter.

/**
 * P10 — whether this row is worth a mirror POST.
 *
 * The dashboard earns its place as the THIRD trigger point because it is the
 * only one on the path of the member the mirror exists for: someone who lives
 * on My Work and opens `/learn` rarely. If mirroring only happened inside the
 * course, the task would arrive on the board at the exact moment it stopped
 * being useful — they were already reading the week.
 *
 * It is also the trigger that has to justify its cost, because this is the
 * most-opened authed page in the app, and it is the only trigger that can fire
 * more than once per mount. Two conditions, and they are the sync-tasks
 * route's OWN conditions restated client-side so the common answer costs no
 * round trip at all (the session-scoped claim in useSyncTasks is the other
 * half of that, and covers the repeat MOUNTS this filter cannot see):
 *
 *   • an ENROLMENT on the run — `learner`/`facilitator` are the two roles that
 *     come from a `courseEnrolments` row, and they are exactly who the route
 *     serves. (Same half as the card's render filter; restated so this
 *     predicate stays correct if that filter ever loosens.) A reviewer's or
 *     track lead's row reaches this card by a different door and earns a 403.
 *   • `phase === "running"` with a started taught week — the route returns
 *     `weekNumber: null` for anything else, and it spends a session
 *     verification (an Auth RPC plus a `users` doc read) and two more doc reads
 *     to say so. Cheap per call, not free, and this card can make up to four of
 *     them.
 *
 * What survives is ~one POST for a member on one live course, which the route
 * answers from the enrolment's high-water mark with no write at all — and,
 * since the trigger's claim is module-scoped, only on the FIRST dashboard visit
 * of a cohort week rather than on every mount (see useSyncTasks).
 *
 * Two known, deliberate gaps, both covered by the other two trigger points:
 *   • enrolment STATUS is invisible here — `/api/courses/me` reports the role
 *     for an active or a `completed` enrolment alike, and the route requires
 *     `active`. A completed enrolment on a still-running run is rare, and the
 *     refusal is swallowed.
 *   • only the `MAX_ROWS` rows this card renders are considered, so a member
 *     on five live courses mirrors four from here and the fifth on the run's
 *     own page. Firing for rows the card does not show would be a hidden cost
 *     on the busiest page in the app.
