/**
 * THE ATTENDANCE REGISTER: one group, every session so far, everyone in it.
 *
 * ── IT IS A REAL TABLE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `<table>` with `<th scope="col">` sessions and `<th scope="row">` names,
 * because that is what it is: a screen reader announces "Ada Lovelace, Week 3,
 * Present" from the headers alone, and keyboard users get the table navigation
 * their software already provides. A grid of divs would need every one of
 * those behaviours reimplemented, badly.
 *
 * ── WHAT MOVES, AND WHAT NEVER DOES ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Cell BACKGROUND and glyph SCALE animate. Row and column geometry NEVER does:
 * a register is read by scanning across a row and down a column, and a width
 * or height that animates drags every other cell out from under the eye that
 * is scanning it. Nothing here transitions width, height, padding or tracks.
 *
 * The glyph pops only where the FACILITATOR just acted (see `pop()`). Mounting
 * a half-marked register would otherwise fire thirty pops at once on load,
 * which reads as the page glitching rather than as feedback.
 *
 * ── THE FIVE-STATE TAP CYCLE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * unmarked, present, late, left-early, absent, excused, back to unmarked.
 * Present first because it is the overwhelmingly common answer and the whole
 * gesture is "tap everyone who came"; the rest in attended-most to
 * attended-least order, which is the order the rollup counts them in, so the
 * cycle reads as a slider rather than as a list. `null` is IN the cycle, not
 * an escape hatch beside it: a mis-tap must be undoable with more taps, never
 * with a modifier key or a second control.
 *
 * ── THE DRAFT / PUSHED BOUNDARY IS THE SHAPE OF THIS SCREEN ─────────────────
 * A column is a draft until PUSH ATTENDANCE. Pushing locks it, rebuilds every
 * member's attendance record and mails the group about the next session, so a
 * pushed column renders as read-only for a facilitator and stays editable for
 * an admin, whose every change is logged. The confirm in front of the button
 * (`PushConfirm`) names who is emailed, that the register locks, and how many
 * people are about to be counted absent for want of a mark.
 *
 * ── MID-RUN JOINERS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Cells before a member's `joinedWeekNumber` are INERT: a dash, not an
 * unmarked cell, with an aria-label that says why. Rendering them as markable
 * would invite a register that says someone was absent from sessions that
 * happened before they existed to the group. The routes refuse those writes
 * too; this is the visible half of one rule.
 *
 * PII: names arrive as `displayName` and render through `MemberName`.
 * Participant notes live behind the drawer, never in a cell, and carry their
 * own disclosure line. There is no email address anywhere in this component's
 * data, by construction.
