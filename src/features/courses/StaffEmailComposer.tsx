/**
 * Write one staff email — to ONE GROUP (the operational lane) or to a WHOLE
 * COHORT (the announcement lane). One component, two audiences, because the
 * guards are the feature and two copies of them would drift.
 *
 * ── EVERY GUARD HERE EXISTS BECAUSE SENDING IS IRREVERSIBLE ─────────────────
 * There is no unsend, no draft state to walk back and no moderation queue
 * behind this form, so the composer is built around three claims it has to be
 * able to make honestly:
 *
 *  1. WHO IT REACHES, stated before the send and restated in the confirm. For a
 *     group the count is the roster route's active members; for a run it is the
 *     number of rows on the cohort channel, counted by the page's server shell,
 *     and stated as "up to N" because opt-outs and suppression are applied
 *     later, server-side, and can only make it smaller. When the count is
 *     unknown the real send is BLOCKED rather than sent with a hedge — a
 *     confirm dialog whose number is a guess is worse than no confirm at all.
 *     The test send stays available, because it reaches nobody but the author.
 *  2. WHAT ACTUALLY WENT OUT, after the fact. The routes report `sent` and
 *     `skipped`; both are shown. "Skipped" covers the suppression list —
 *     addresses that have bounced or been marked as spam — plus, on the run
 *     lane, everyone who has turned course announcements off. Folding those
 *     into a cheerful "sent to everyone" would quietly hide the one thing a
 *     facilitator needs to know about a member who never hears from them.
 *  3. THAT IT HAS NOT ALREADY GONE — see the next block, which is the whole
 *     reason this component holds state at all.
 *
 * ── THE DOUBLE-SEND GUARD ARMS BEFORE DISPATCH, NOT ON SUCCESS ──────────────
 * The attempt is recorded the instant Send is pressed, BEFORE the request
 * leaves — because that is the instant the message may start reaching people.
 * Arming on the response instead would leave the one case that actually
 * duplicates mail wide open: a request that dies (dropped connection, a
 * timeout) AFTER the route's per-recipient loop has begun sends to some of the
 * list, returns no report, and — if the button re-armed only on success —
 * leaves an untouched-looking Send holding the identical text.
 *
 * So a failure does not clear the guard. It moves the attempt to one of two
 * states, and they are not the same thing:
 *
 *   REFUSED  — the route answered with a sentence (a validation error, a rate
 *              limit, the over-cap refusal). Both send routes return every
 *              refusal BEFORE the first `sendEmail`, so a sentence is proof
 *              nothing went out; the guard does not arm and the author can fix
 *              and retry immediately. If a route ever starts refusing mid-loop,
 *              this classification has to change with it.
 *   UNKNOWN  — anything else: no response, an unparseable one, a bare 5xx. We
 *              cannot say whether the loop ran, so we say exactly that. The
 *              guard stays armed and a resend needs an explicit
 *              acknowledgement that some people may get the message twice.
 *
 * A clean success blocks the identical text outright — edit it to send again —
 * which is the rule that was already here.
 *
 * Test sends carry their own attempt record, deliberately separate: proofing a
 * message must never look like sending it, and (the older bug) a test must
 * never clear the guard on a real send that has already happened.
 *
 * ── NO ADDRESSES, EITHER DIRECTION ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * This form never sees an email address. It posts a subject and a body; the
 * route resolves recipients server-side, filters the suppression list and
 * returns counts only. The group roster it counts from carries names, and they
 * are not rendered here at all; the run count crosses as a bare number.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Toast, not inline, for both actions (the plan's toast-vs-inline rule): a
 * send is a must-not-continue action other people will read.
