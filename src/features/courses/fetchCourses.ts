/**
 * Server-only fetchers for the public course pages (`fetchEvents.ts` pattern).
 *
 * These run through the Admin SDK, so Firestore rules provide NO defence here —
 * deliberately, because no public read rule exists for `courses` / `courseRuns`
 * / `weeks` (`allow read` grants `list`, which would make every draft
 * world-listable). Visibility is therefore OURS to enforce, and every function
 * below filters on it before returning anything:
 *
 *  - courses must be `status === "published"`,
 *  - the showcase run must not be a `draft`,
 *  - runs must not be `archived`,
 *  - weeks must be `published === true`.
 *
 * Any new fetcher added here inherits that obligation.
 *
 * There is a SECOND obligation, added when the read-time application window
 * landed: nothing in this file may decide whether a run is taking
 * applications by looking at `status` on its own. `courseRunWindow()` in
 * `lib/courses/enrolWindow.ts` is the only predicate, and the routes call the
 * predicate it dispatches to. Keying on status alone is what let a run sit
 * past its deadline advertising an open application and then refuse the POST.
 *
 * `courseRunWindow()` rather than `applicationWindow()` directly, because
 * there are now TWO ways onto a run. An `open` run (the pre-course) has no
 * application at all and admits people while it is `applications-closed` or
 * even `running`; asking the application predicate about one would report
 * "closed" about a bootcamp taking sign-ups that evening. The dispatcher
 * picks by `enrolMode`, and every window in this file goes through it.
 *
 * `archived` is the V2-1 deletion protocol's everyday soft path, and this
 * file is where most of its promise is kept: "an archived run drops out of
 * the public catalogue" is only true because the two run lookups below skip
 * it and the showcase resolution treats it like a draft. The destroy cascade
 * sets the same flag in its opening transaction, so a run mid-destroy is off
 * these surfaces before the first row dies — which is the whole "unreachable
 * at destroy start" guarantee, and it is worth exactly as much as these
 * filters are.
