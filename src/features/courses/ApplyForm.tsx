 *
 * Every write goes to `/api/courses/runs/[runId]/apply` (POST / PATCH /
 * DELETE) — `courseApplications` is `allow write: if false`, so there is no
 * client-direct path even in principle. Nothing here is a gate: the route
 * re-checks the window, the cap, the pause flag, the cooldown and the caller's
 * role on every call. What this component owes the applicant is an honest
 * account of what happened, which is why route errors are surfaced verbatim
 * rather than flattened into "something went wrong".
 *
 * Two deliberate absences:
 *  - No facilitator picker. Applicants don't choose who teaches them;
 *    admissions records preferences later (`facilitatorPreferenceUids` is
 *    written by the review flow, never by this form).
 *  - No paid-membership anything. The tag is a badge for reviewers and is
 *    snapshotted server-side at submit; it never appears on a member surface
 *    and never branches a route.
