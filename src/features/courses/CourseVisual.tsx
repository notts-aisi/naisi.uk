/**
 * THE GENERATED PER-TRACK VISUAL.
 *
 * Every course gets artwork without anybody having to make any. The picture is
 * a pure function of two stored values, the page's `visualSeed` and the
 * course's `track`, so it is stable across renders, identical on the server
 * and the client (no hydration mismatch, no `useId`), and re-rollable by an
 * author typing a new seed.
 *
 * ## Why generated rather than an image
 *
 * Three reasons, in order of how much they cost when ignored:
 *
 *  1. A course with no cover image still has to look like something. The
 *     catalogue is a grid, and a grid of text blocks reads as an unfinished
 *     admin list rather than as a programme worth applying to.
 *  2. There is no image to host, resize, ship or forget the alt text on. This
 *     is inline SVG in the document: no request, no layout shift, no external
 *     asset for the CSP to allow, nothing to regenerate when the brand script
 *     runs.
 *  3. It themes. Every colour is a token, so light mode and any future palette
 *     swap come free, which a baked PNG does not.
 *
 * ## The cover override
 *
 * An author who HAS a picture wins: `coverImageUrl` replaces the generated
 * composition entirely, rendered as a plain `<img>` (never `next/image`, see
 * the repo note; the default import resolves to an object under the Turbopack
 * production build). It requires `coverAlt`, which the write route enforces,
 * because an image with no alternative text is announced as nothing on a page
 * whose whole job is explaining a programme.
 *
 * The generated composition, by contrast, is DECORATIVE: `aria-hidden`, no
 * title, no role. It carries no information the surrounding copy does not, and
 * announcing "abstract pattern of circles" to a screen reader on every card is
 * noise, not access.
