/**
 * The allocation payload for one course run, plus the three mutations the
 * board drives: `GET/POST /api/courses/runs/[runId]/allocation*`.
 *
 * One-shot fetch with a manual refresh — the `useRunApplications` idiom, for
 * the same two reasons and one more:
 *
 *  1. `courseEnrolments` is own-row-read + admin in rules, so a non-admin
 *     TRACK LEAD cannot read the collection from the client at all. The route
 *     is the only way they see the board, and it is also what strips applicant
 *     email addresses out of the payload — allocation is a NAME-ONLY surface
 *     (locked decision: facilitators and track leads never see addresses).
 *  2. Nothing moves behind the allocator's back. A run is placed in one
 *     sitting by the person looking at the screen.
 *  3. Placement is transactional server-side (capacity is checked against the
 *     in-transaction `memberCount`), so the only trustworthy view of "who is
 *     where" is the one the server just committed. Every action below
 *     re-reads rather than patching local state; the board layers a short
 *     optimistic override on top purely so a dropped card doesn't visibly
 *     snap back during the round trip.
 *
 * ── THE INVARIANT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One enrolment per (run, uid) — deterministic doc id `courseEnrolmentId(runId,
 * uid)` — and `groupId` is a single scalar. Double placement is structurally
 * impossible, not merely prevented. Nothing in this file may ever model group
 * membership as an array of uids: a group's members are `people.filter(p =>
 * p.groupId === group.id)`, always a query over the one scalar.
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
