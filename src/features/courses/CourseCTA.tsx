/**
 * The apply call-to-action on a public course page. A client island purely
 * because it branches on whether the visitor is signed in; everything around
 * it stays a server component.
 *
 * Three things this file is careful about:
 *
 * 1. **It branches on the WINDOW, not the status.** The run's window state is
 *    computed server-side by the one predicate the apply route also uses
 *    (`lib/courses/window.ts`), so this can no longer offer an Apply button
 *    for a run whose deadline has passed. That mismatch was the blocker: the
 *    button worked, the form rendered, and the POST refused it.
 * 2. **The run LABEL never appears inside a sentence.** It is an internal
 *    handle an admin typed ("Autumn 2026", or "wd" while someone was
 *    testing), and "Applications open for wd" shipped to dev reading exactly
 *    like that. Sentences use the course title and real dates; the label gets
 *    a chip, where a short scrappy string is fine.
 * 3. **It does NOT branch on role.** `/courses/[courseId]/apply` lives in the
 *    PUBLIC route group precisely so a `pending` account can reach it. Every
 *    signed-in visitor gets the same link, and the apply page itself is the
 *    one place that says no. Branching here would need `role`, which lands a
 *    beat after `user` and would flicker the button for everyone.
 * 4. **Two ways onto a run, one component.** An `admissions` run sends people
 *    to the application form; an `open` one (the pre-course) puts the session
 *    picker right here, because there is nothing to review and no decision to
 *    wait for. The copy differs throughout: an open run is not "taking
 *    applications", it is taking sign-ups, and telling a fresher they have
 *    applied to something that admits everyone is a promise of a wait that
 *    will never come.
