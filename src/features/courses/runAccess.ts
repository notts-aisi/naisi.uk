/**
 * The learning space's server-side gate: who is asking, which run, and what
 * they may see of it.
 *
 * `cache()`-wrapped so the `[runId]` layout and the page inside it share ONE
 * set of Firestore reads per request. Next.js layouts cannot pass data to
 * their children, so the page has to ask again; `cache` is what makes asking
 * again free (it is per-request memoisation, not a cross-request cache — there
 * is no staleness window for a role change to slip through).
 *
 * ── WHAT `null` MEANS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "There is nothing here for you": no session, Admin SDK unconfigured, or no
 * such run. Callers redirect rather than render, and a missing run is
 * DELIBERATELY indistinguishable from a run you hold no role on — a member
 * guessing run ids learns nothing about which ones exist. When a caller needs
 * to tell "signed out" from "no such run" (the layout does, to choose between
 * /login and /learn) it calls `getSessionUser()` below, which is already
 * memoised by then and costs nothing.
 *
 * A caller with NO role at all still gets a non-null `RunAccess` — every flag
 * false. Deciding what that means is the caller's job, because the answer
 * differs per route (the run home bounces, admissions narrows to its own
 * predicate).
 *
 * ── THIS IS A UI GATE, NOT THE BOUNDARY ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Every courses API route re-derives its own access from the same documents,
 * and firestore.rules gates the one client-direct write. Nothing here is
 * trusted by anything that returns data; it exists so members do not get
 * shown doors that open onto a 403.
