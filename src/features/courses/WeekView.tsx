/**
 * The member week page: header + ProgressBar (the spatial anchor — they NEVER
 * animate position across week↔week navigation), pacing banner, the shared
 * WeekCurriculum spine with check-off buttons hung off every row, the
 * reflection panel and cohort-notes lane under each material, the exercise
 * submission forms under each prompt, and the footer week nav. Plan sections:
 * "Placement map — Week page", "Check-off choreography", "Toast vs inline
 * rule" — the timings here are theirs.
 *
 * Data: one overview fetch (run + current week + own enrolment + group), one
 * week-doc get, the live own-progress listener, and — for learners only — one
 * fetch of their own answers for this week. The listener is what settles the
 * optimistic check-off; the `overrides` map below only bridges the microtask
 * gap before the local write lands in the snapshot — and, on a refused write,
 * holds the flip until the 200ms revert.
 *
 * Toast vs inline: check-off FAILURE is the only toast on this page. Saves of
 * the reflection panel and exercise autosave are keep-working feedback →
 * inline SavedFlash; an admin hiding or unhiding a cohort comment is a
 * must-not-continue action and takes the toast.
 *
 * PROGRESS SEMANTICS ARE UNCHANGED BY EXERCISES: the fraction counts
 * non-optional materials plus checklist items and nothing else. An exercise is
 * work with a verdict on it, not a box to tick, and folding submissions into
 * the bar would make 100% unreachable until a facilitator got round to it.

 * exists on My Work, so the second, un-ticked card turns up there looking like
 * work they have already done. Both halves, or neither.
 *
 * Same restraint as TaskCard's note, for the same reason: this is one row on a
 * page of rows, so what SHOWS is a four-word marker and the sentence itself
 * rides in a `title` plus visually-hidden text (a `title` alone is unreliable
 * for screen readers). A standing paragraph on every mirrored row would cost
