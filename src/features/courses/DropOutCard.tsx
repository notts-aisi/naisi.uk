/**
 * Leaving a course, behind a typed confirmation of the course title.
 *
 * ── WHY THE RITUAL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is the only member-facing action in the courses feature that the
 * person taking it cannot undo: the enrolment row lives at a deterministic id
 * that survives the drop, so re-enrolling is something staff have to do. A
 * plain confirm dialog is one mis-tap on a phone away from that. Typing the
 * course title is the same ritual the destroy routes use, and the server
 * checks it too (byte equality) rather than trusting this form.
 *
 * ── THE REASON BOX ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Optional, always. It goes to the staff review surface and is never shown
 * back to the cohort. The anonymous form offered afterwards is the other half
 * of the same question and is deliberately separate: this box is attached to
 * a name, that one is not, and somebody who will not write the first may well
 * write the second.
 *
 * ── THE CONFIRMATION IS NOT THIS COMPONENT'S TO SHOW ────────────────────────
 * It used to be, and it was never once seen: the moment `onDropped` fires,
 * the picker re-reads, the member's row comes back `withdrawn`, and the
 * branch that renders this card is gone along with the card. So the "you're
 * off the course" line and the feedback link live in the parent, which is the
 * component still on screen afterwards, and this one hands the URL up.
