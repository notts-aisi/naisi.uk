/**

 * it: these are low-churn editorial collections opened by one or two people,
 * and an always-open listener per surface is a standing read cost for no
 * benefit. Every hook returns that hook's shape verbatim —
 * `{ items, loading, refreshing, error, reload }` — so a page can wire the
 * Refresh button straight through after a mutation.
 *
 * No `orderBy` anywhere: Firestore drops docs missing the ordered field, which
 * would silently hide a half-authored draft. Sorting is
 * client-side, on fields that may legitimately be blank.
