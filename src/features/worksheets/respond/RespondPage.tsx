/**
 * ONE RECIPIENT ANSWERING ONE CIRCULATION.
 *
 * ── THE RULES DECIDE WHO GETS IN, NOT A LAYOUT GATE ─────────────────────────
 * There is no role check above this page beyond the authed shell. A recipient
 * proves themselves with the document that exists for exactly one reason,
 * their own response, and the circulation's read rule is an `exists()` on it.
 * So somebody who is not a recipient gets a refusal on both reads and lands on
 * the not-found state below. Adding a role gate would be a second, weaker copy
 * of that check: recipients are committee members today and need not be
 * tomorrow (docs/worksheets.md: "a recipient is a response document and a
 * task, whatever their role").
 *
 * ── WHAT IS LOCAL AND WHAT IS THE DOCUMENT ──────────────────────────────────
 * `answers` is local state, seeded from the response and authoritative for
 * everything on screen while the recipient types: the autosave echoing back
 * through the listener must never re-seed mid-sentence. It is re-seeded on
 * exactly one transition, into a FROZEN state, which is where the document
 * becomes the authority again (the submit route re-derives progress and the
 * page turns read-only).
 *
 * ── SAVING IS THREE THINGS, IN ONE ORDER ────────────────────────────────────
 * Autosave (debounced, per changed question), Save (flush now), and Submit
 * (flush, then POST). Submit flushes FIRST for the reason ExerciseSubmit
 * spells out: a pending 900ms write landing after the submit would overwrite
 * the submitted answers with the older draft, and the document would then
 * disagree with the page under a green banner.
 *
 * ── VALIDATION IS THE ROUTE'S, RUN EARLY ────────────────────────────────────
 * `validateSubmission` is the shared model function the submit route runs
 * against the same items, so a submission this page allows is one the route
 * accepts. Running it here buys the recipient the page number of their first
 * mistake instead of a sentence about a question they cannot see.
