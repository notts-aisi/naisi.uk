/**
 * The library's client-direct writes: worksheets and the folders they sit in.
 *
 * EVERYTHING HERE IS CLIENT-DIRECT EXCEPT THE DELETE, and that is the split
 * the feature is built on. A worksheet is content its author owns, and
 * `firestore.rules` can express every invariant that matters about it:
 * `authorUid` pinned, `private` admin-only in both directions, the three size
 * caps. Circulating one is the opposite (it copies a worksheet, writes a
 * response document and a task per recipient, and sends mail), so that is a
 * route, and nothing in this file touches a circulation.
 *
 * Deleting is the other exception, for two reasons no rule can reach: the
 * question images live in Storage, where no client may delete, and an open
 * circulation of the worksheet has to refuse the delete, which means counting
 * documents in another collection. See `deleteWorksheet` below.
 *
 * NO `undefined` EVER REACHES FIRESTORE. A client-direct write refuses an
 * explicit undefined outright, including one nested inside an array, so every
 * patch below is built key by key and every nullable field is written as an
 * explicit `null`. Items go through `sanitizeItems`, which rebuilds each
 * question key by key for the same reason.

/**
 * WHY NOTHING CHECKS WHETHER A NEW DOC ID IS TAKEN.
 *
 * A worksheet's id is `slugId(title)`: the slug, then eight base36 characters.
 * The obvious guard is a `get` on the candidate before writing it, and it was
 * written that way first. It cannot answer. A `get` of a document that does NOT
 * exist leaves `resource` null, and the worksheets read rule dereferences
 * `resource.data.private`, so for anybody but an admin the missing-document
 * case comes back as permission-denied rather than as an empty snapshot. That
 * case is the overwhelmingly common one, so the check cost every committee
 * member a round trip and a console refusal on every create to learn nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IS LEFT TO CHANCE, so the omission reads as a decision. Landing on an
 * existing id means matching the slug AND one of roughly 2.8 trillion suffixes.
 * Every collision but one is refused by the rules on the way out: a `setDoc`
 * over somebody else's worksheet is an update with a changed `authorUid`, and
 * the update rule pins it. The one the rules cannot catch is a collision with
 * the caller's OWN worksheet, which reads as a legitimate update.

 * Delete a shelf, re-filing the caller's OWN worksheets off it on the way.
 *
 * THE DELETE IS NEVER HELD HOSTAGE BY SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORKSHEET, which is what
 * an all-or-nothing re-file of everything on the shelf made it. A committee
 * member may update only worksheets whose `authorUid` is theirs, so the moment
 * a second author had filed anything here the whole batch was refused, the
 * shelf survived, and the only recourse was an admin. Folders are shared
 * furniture on purpose (no ownership gate in the rules, so a shelf whose maker
 * has left the committee is still one somebody can tidy), and a delete that
 * only its lucky sole user can perform is not that.
 *
 * SO THE READ IS SCOPED TO THE CALLER'S OWN WORKSHEETS. `where("authorUid",
 * "==", uid)` is also the shape the rules prove the author branch from, so the
 * read is granted whether or not the documents are private, and every update in
 * the batch is one the caller is certainly allowed to make. The folder document
 * goes whatever else is filed on it.
 *
 * DANGLING `folderId` POINTERS ARE THE DESIGN HERE, not a leak. `firestore.rules`
 * says so on the `worksheetFolders` block: rules cannot cascade, a client
 * cascade is a fan-out write the deleter may not be allowed to make, and the
 * library therefore reads a folderId that resolves to nothing as "No folder"
 * (WorksheetLibrary does exactly that). The repo-wide cascade-delete sweep on
 * the backlog is the real fix; re-filing what the caller may touch is the
 * honest half of it until then. An admin could re-file everybody's, and
 * deliberately does not: one query shape for one operation, and the reader sees
 * the same "No folder" either way.
 *
 * ONE BATCH, so the re-file and the delete land together and there is no window
 * in which a worksheet is unfiled while its shelf is still on the bar.
 *
 * `updatedAt` IS NOT BUMPED on the re-filed worksheets. Their content did not
 * change, a shelf disappeared under them, and marking them updated would
 * attribute a change to an author who made none and re-sort the library under
 * everyone.
