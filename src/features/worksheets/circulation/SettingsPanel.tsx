/**
 * The settings of a circulation that has already gone out: its due date, what
 * reviewers may write, and which messages it sends.
 *
 * ── WHY THESE ARE EDITABLE AT ALL, HAVING BEEN SET AT SEND TIME ─────────────
 * Wave 1 rendered them read-only with a note saying so, because "what should
 * somebody already told about a message hear when it is switched off" is a
 * real question. The answer this wave takes is: NOTHING, and that is fine.
 * Every message these switches gate is fired by a FUTURE event (a new
 * recipient, a submission, a deadline two days out, a return), so turning one
 * off silences what has not happened yet and cannot unsend what has. The one
 * setting with any reach backwards is `returnToRecipient`, and it is honest
 * there too: it decides what happens to responses returned FROM NOW ON, which
 * the note under those switches says out loud.
 *
 * ── EVERY CHANGE SAVES ITSELF ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No Save button and no draft state. Each switch writes its own field with
 * `updateDoc`, inside the key list the circulations update rule allows, and
 * the page's live listener is what re-renders it: the Firestore client applies
 * a local write to the snapshot before the server answers, so the switch moves
 * at once and settles when the write lands. Holding a local copy beside a live
 * listener would mean two sources of truth fighting over one switch, which is
 * how a toggle ends up flicking back under somebody's finger.
 *
 * The consequence, stated because it is a real one: two staff editing the same
 * circulation at the same time is last-write-wins per field. The whole feature
 * says so (`docs/worksheets.md`, out of scope in v1), and a switch is a small
 * enough unit that the loser can see what happened and flick it back.
 *
 * ── WHO MAY BE HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing in this component checks. It is mounted by `CirculationPage`, which
 * renders the whole page as an EmptyState for anybody who is not staff, and
 * the rule refuses the write regardless. A second check here would be a second
 * place for the answer to drift.

/**
 * One `updateDoc` payload: FIELD PATHS and their values, never a rebuilt map.
 *
 * A dotted path (`notifications.dueSoon.email`) writes one leaf. Rebuilding
 * the whole `notifications` object from the prop, which is what this panel
 * used to do, carries every OTHER switch's value as it stood when this render
 * read it: two switches flipped inside one render window would both write the
 * pre-first-write map, and the first change would silently revert under
 * somebody's finger. Lossy, and invisible when it happens.
 *
 * The rule is satisfied either way. `affectedKeys()` reports the TOP-LEVEL key
 * (`notifications`, `reviewConfig`, `dueDate`), all three of which are in the
 * circulations update rule's list, whether the write replaced a map, changed
 * one boolean inside it, or replaced the reminder schedule's whole array at
 * `notifications.dueSoon.slots`. That is what let the schedule live inside
 * `notifications` with no rules change and no deploy.
 *
 * A leaf write on a document whose map is incomplete is safe too:
 * `normalizeNotifications` fills every missing event AND every missing channel
 * from `DEFAULT_NOTIFICATIONS` on the way in, so a sibling this write never
 * mentions is read as its default rather than as `undefined`.

   * THE ONE CONTROL HERE THAT IS NOT SAVED ON TOUCH, and the reason is the
   * control rather than the policy.
   *
   * Every switch above writes itself because a switch has two states and each
   * one is a finished decision. The reminder schedule is TYPED: "14" passes
   * through "1", and "10:30" passes through four states that are not times at
   * all. Saving per keystroke would write a document per character, and would
   * store 1 day on the way to 14; letting the live listener drive the rows
   * instead would fight the cursor. So this block holds a draft and saves it
   * on a button, which is also the shape the round editor uses for the same
   * list.
   *
   * The draft re-seeds whenever the STORED schedule changes: after our own
   * save lands (which is what clears the Save button), and when another
   * staff member saves theirs while this one is open. The second case
   * replaces what is being typed, which is last-write-wins made visible, and
   * is the same answer the rest of this panel gives.
   *
   * The signature ignores slot ids, because `sanitizeSlots` may mint one on
   * the way in and a re-minted id is not somebody's edit.
