/**
 * The manual lane for the deadline reminders, on the round page.
 *
 * The scheduler tick sends these on its own. This is here because a round's
 * schedule is a handful of dates chosen on purpose (a free list, capped at
 * six, counted back from the closing date), and a slipped tick on one of them
 * is a missed deadline rather than a late email. It calls the SAME handler the
 * tick calls, scoped to this round, so it cannot double-send: anybody the
 * tick already mailed holds a stamped marker and is skipped.
 *
 * It names no slot of its own. The button sends whatever the round's schedule
 * says is due right now, so a round that has been given a fourth reminder, or
 * had its rows rewritten, needs no change here.
 *
 * ## Two presses, deliberately
 *
 * The first press asks. Sending mail to everyone holding a draft is not
 * undoable, and this button sits directly under a list of number inputs
 * somebody has just been editing, which is exactly the place a stray click
 * lands. The confirmation names what will happen rather than asking "are you
 * sure".
 *
 * ## The receipt is the point
 *
 * "Sent" alone would leave the presser wondering whether anything happened.
 * The three numbers are the honest answer, including the two that are usually
 * zero: `skipped` covers suppressed addresses and opt-outs, and `stale` means
 * a due date was too old to mail, which is the one outcome somebody pressing
 * this button on a slipped tick needs to see.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT show is a count of who is left. The run only
 * ever loaded a page of the audience, and most of those may already hold a
 * stamped marker from an earlier press, so any such number would read "150
 * still to go" in front of a second press that sends nothing. "There may be
 * more: press again" is what the run actually knows.
