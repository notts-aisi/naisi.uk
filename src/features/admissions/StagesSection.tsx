/**
 * The stages: each one a block of questions with its own release date.
 *
 * ## Why the questions are edited here and nowhere else
 *
 * `admissionRounds/{roundId}/stages/{stageId}` is `allow read, write: if
 * false`, which is the timed-release guarantee itself: the only way a question
 * reaches a browser is a route that checked `isStageReleased` first. So this
 * editor talks to the stage route rather than writing client-direct like the
 * course editors do, and the questions it renders arrived on a payload that
 * only an author is served.
 *
 * ## The character limit is checked by the SERVER, and named
 *
 * `FormBuilder` offers a per-question character limit. A number out of range
 * is refused by the stage route with the question named, because the sanitiser
 * behind the save is `raw.filter(isValidQuestion)`: a range check inside that
 * predicate would delete the question instead of complaining about it. The
 * refusal is surfaced verbatim here.

/**
 * One plain sentence about what pressing Release just did.

 * The release and the announcement are two different things and this line
 * always says so, because "released" on its own leaves an admin guessing
 * whether anybody was told.
 *
 * ONE SENTENCE PER REASON, and the reason comes off the notice rather than
 * being inferred here. An earlier version inferred it, and said "this stage
 * had already been announced" to every case the job declined, a round whose
 * window is not open included: an admin reading that goes looking for an
 * announcement nobody made.
 *
 * FAILURES ARE READ FIRST. A transport outage during a hand release leaves an
 * empty audience behind it, and reporting that as "nobody has a live
 * application" would be the one wrong answer with a remedy attached.
