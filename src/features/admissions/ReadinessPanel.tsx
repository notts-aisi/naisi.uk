/**
 * What is still missing before this round can open, one line per blocker, each
 * with a link to the section that fixes it.
 *
 * The list comes from `roundReadiness`, which is the SAME predicate the status
 * route refuses on. That is the whole design: a panel with its own opinion
 * would eventually show a green tick beside a button that answers 409, and the
 * author would have no way to tell which of the two was lying.
 *
 * Met checks are shown too, greyed, rather than disappearing. A panel that
 * empties as you go gives no sense of what the bar actually is, and the first
 * time somebody authors a round they want to read the whole list.
 *
 * The kind note under the heading is there for the same reason. An appointment
 * round is held to five checks and an enrolment round to six, and a list that
 * is quietly one line shorter reads as a bug rather than as a decision.
