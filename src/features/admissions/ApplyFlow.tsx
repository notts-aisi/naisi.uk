/**
 * The applicant's whole journey on one round, from "start an application" to
 * "here is what you sent us".
 *
 * ## Why it is one island rather than a page per state
 *
 * There are seven states (no row yet, draft, submitted, a later stage open,
 * withdrawn while open, withdrawn after close, decided) and every one of them
 * is reachable from the same URL, because the URL is the round. Splitting them
 * across routes would mean a redirect on every transition, which on a phone at
 * a fair is a full page load between "Submit" and the confirmation.
 *
 * ## The draft is on the server, and this component never pretends otherwise
 *
 * Everything typed here lives in React state until a save, and the save bar
 * says so at all times: dirty, saving, or saved at a time. There is no
 * localStorage mirror, deliberately. Two copies of an application with no
 * reconciliation is how somebody's laptop draft silently overwrites the newer
 * one they wrote on their phone, and this form is the one place in the site
 * where that would cost a person a place on a programme.
 *
 * ## reCAPTCHA is minted per action
 *
 * The token is executed at the moment the button is pressed, never at page
 * load. Google's tokens go stale in about two minutes and an applicant writing
 * a five-hundred-word answer is well past that, so a page-load token would
 * fail the very submission it was there to protect. The autosave deliberately
 * carries no token at all (see `applyRoutes.ts`).
 *
 * ## An appointment round is a different form, not a differently-worded one
 *
 * A round of kind `appointment` is the facilitator intake. It mounts NO
 * programme-preference section at all: the gate is the kind, not
 * `programmePreference.enabled`, so a stray enabled flag on an appointment
 * round cannot put a "which programme would you like" block in front of
 * somebody who is volunteering to run one. The PATCH route refuses to store
 * that flag on this kind, and this check means the form would still be right
 * if it ever did. Everything the applicant is asked to CALL the form comes
 * from `applyCopy`, so the wording cannot drift between here and the page.
 *
 * ## Everything a member typed renders through MemberText
 *
 * The view-only rendering after submit shows the applicant their own answers.
 * They are member-authored strings, so they go through `MemberText`, which
 * renders a text node and nothing else.
