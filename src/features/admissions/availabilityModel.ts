/**
 * The AvailabilityGrid component's state model, kept OUT of the component file
 * on purpose.
 *
 * Two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one:
 *
 *  1. A grid of 336 cells with pointer painting, a roving tabindex and a
 *     shift-range is enough behaviour that the state transitions want to be
 *     readable on their own, without a JSX file around them.
 *  2. The round trip THROUGH THE WIRE FORMAT is the thing that must not
 *     break. A drawn grid is stored as seven hex strings and read back by the
 *     decide route to build a seat row's availability labels, so a bug here
 *     does not show up as a broken screen: it shows up as somebody being put
 *     in a session they said they could not make. These functions are
 *     therefore unit tested by `tests/admissions-apply-flow.test.mjs`, which
 *     transpiles plain TypeScript and cannot import a `.tsx` file.
 *
 * The component holds `boolean[][]` (seven day columns of `slotCountFor(grid)`
 * booleans) and converts at the edges only. Nothing in the UI ever touches
 * hex.
