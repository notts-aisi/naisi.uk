/**
 * THE UNMARKED-REGISTER FOLLOW-UP: `src/lib/courses/unmarkedRegisters.ts`,
 * plus the source-level orderings in the job and in the attendance push that
 * no pure function can pin.
 *
 * What is being pinned here, and why each one would be expensive to discover
 * in production:
 *
 *  1. THE SCAN BAND'S BOUNDARIES. Inclusive at the grace, exclusive 24 hours
 *     later. Get the bottom wrong and a session is chased an hour early or a
 *     tick late; get the top wrong and either the band and the band after it
 *     both claim the same session (two cards) or neither does (silence). None
 *     of that shows up in a log.
 *  2. THE CURSOR. A resumable scan that forgets where it was does the same
 *     reads every tick and never reaches the tail of the run list, so the
 *     groups at the end of the alphabet are the ones nobody chases and
 *     nothing says so.
 *  3. THE READ-BACK. A task's id says nothing about who made it. The
 *     three-legged identity test is what lets the job trust a task it reads
 *     back, and each leg is tested on its own.
 *  4. THE ORDERINGS. Marker claimed BEFORE the task is minted and stamped
 *     after; the push's archive AFTER its transaction commits. Both are
 *     policy rather than logic, so both are asserted at the source, exactly
 *     as `course-sessions.test.mjs` asserts the push's own marker ordering.
 *
 * ## The loader dance
 *
 * Lifted from `tests/course-sessions.test.mjs`. This repo's Node is v20 and
 * cannot import a `.ts` file, so the module graph is transpiled in memory
 * with the `typescript` devDependency. Nothing in `STUBS` is reachable from
 * an assertion here.
