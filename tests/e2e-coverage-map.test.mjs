/**
 * The end-to-end COVERAGE MAP (run under `npm test`: no browser, no network,
 * no credentials).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The other guards in this repo ask "is this thing correct".
 * This one asks "is this thing tested at all", which is the question nobody
 * answers on their own initiative. A suite of end-to-end specs grows in the
 * direction of whatever was last broken, and the surfaces nobody has looked at
 * are exactly the surfaces nobody knows are uncovered. So the map is written
 * down, checked in both directions, and every gap carries a reason and the
 * trigger that closes it.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS.
 *
 *  1. It WALKS `src/app` for every `route.ts` and every `page.tsx` and keys
 *     them the way a SPEC's `covers` does: the path under `src/app` with the
 *     trailing `/route.ts` or `/page.tsx` removed, route groups kept verbatim.
 *     A hand-written list of routes is a list that is wrong by the end of the
 *     week, so there is no hand-written list.
 *  2. The EXERCISED set is assembled from two places: every `SPEC.covers` in
 *     `scripts/e2e-fixtures/` whose `SPEC.status` is "verified", and the
 *     `AUTH_BATTERIES` map below, which names what each fetch battery under
 *     `scripts/e2e/tests/` drives.
 *  3. Everything else must be in `NOT_COVERED`, with a written reason and a
 *     written trigger. A key with neither an exercising spec nor an entry
 *     fails, naming itself.
 *
 * A SPEC WHOSE STATUS IS "unverified" CONTRIBUTES NOTHING. A spec that has
 * never passed end to end proves nothing about the routes it names, and a
 * coverage map that counted intentions would be a map that lies in the
 * direction nobody checks. Those specs are printed on every run, so writing
 * one and never running it is loud rather than quiet.
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS, like every registry in this repo. An entry whose key no
 * longer exists fails (the route moved and the reason went stale with it). An
 * entry whose key a verified spec now covers fails (the burn-down rule: a
 * spec's pull request moves its keys out of this list in the same diff). A
 * `covers` key that resolves to no file fails, which
 * `tests/funnel-harness-guards.test.mjs` also checks, deliberately: the two
 * guards disagree the day somebody edits one of them.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. It reads declarations, not behaviour. A spec that visits
 * a page and asserts nothing about it still counts that page as covered, and
 * an API route a page calls internally is covered only because a human wrote
 * it into `covers`. The map's honesty therefore rests on the SPEC modules
 * being honest about what they drove, which is the same bargain
 * `KNOWN_MISSING_INDEXES` and `MUST_GUARD` make.

/**
 * The nine batteries under `scripts/e2e/tests/`, and the routes each one

 * directions: a battery with no entry fails, an entry naming a file that is
 * gone fails, and a `drives` key that is not a route or page in `src/app`
 * fails.
 *
 * These are `fetch()` batteries rather than browser specs, so what they prove
 * is narrower: the route answers correctly. Nothing about the page that calls
 * it. That is enough to call the ROUTE exercised, which is what this map is
 * about, and it is why the pages in `redirectOnly` below are NOT counted.
 *
 * BOTH CI JOBS RUN THEM (`npm run e2e:local` in the local job, `npm run e2e`
 * in the dev job, before each one's browser step), because a credit collected
 * by no job is a credit that rots. If that ever stops being true, the honest
 * move is to say so here rather than to keep counting these routes.
