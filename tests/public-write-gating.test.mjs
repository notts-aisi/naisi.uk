/**
 * AN ENDPOINT A STRANGER CAN DRIVE TO A SIDE EFFECT IS GATED LIKE ONE.
 *
 * WHY. A public endpoint that answers a submission by writing a row and
 * posting an email to an address the caller chose, carrying a greeting name
 * and free-text answers the caller also chose, is an outbound mailer signed by
 * the society. `POST /api/events/[id]/rsvp` is one, so it is gated the way
 * `/api/register` is: a per-IP throttle before any document is read, a
 * per-address throttle after the format check, and reCAPTCHA.
 *
 * The class is wider than one route, so the guard walks the tree:
 *
 *  1. THE SCAN decides, per exported handler under `src/app/api`, whether an
 *     anonymous caller reaches its body. A handler is session-required only
 *     when a refusal keyed on an identity the session gate returned sits at
 *     the TOP LEVEL of the handler. A refusal nested inside another condition,
 *     such as `if (visibility === "members") { if (!viewer) return refuse(); }`,
 *     is not a gate, so a checker that asked whether the file mentions a
 *     session at all would call that handler gated.
 *  2. THE REGISTRY answers for each one what it does and what gates it, with a
 *     written reason. Both directions. A handler the scan calls
 *     anonymous-reachable and the registry does not name FAILS, so a new
 *     public route arrives already having to answer the question.
 *  3. THE RULE. An anonymous handler that SENDS to a caller-chosen address
 *     carries a rate limit, and either a captcha or a per-address cooldown
 *     that bounds how often one address can be written to. One that WRITES
 *     carries a rate limit or a credential the caller had to present. Every
 *     literal named is checked against the file rather than believed.
 *
 * The runtime half is `scripts/e2e/tests/public-write-gating.test.mjs`, which
 * asks a deployed backend whether the RSVP captcha is really live, the same
 * way `recaptcha-gate.test.mjs` asks it of `/api/register`. A gate that is
 * configured out of existence on one backend is invisible to a source scan.
