/**
 * The numbering and validation behind `/sources`
 * (`src/lib/firestore/sourceSheets.ts`).
 *
 * Run with `npm test`.
 *
 * ## Why this file is worth more than the rest of the feature's tests
 *
 * Every other mistake in a source sheet is fixable with a deploy. A SOURCE
 * NUMBER is not: it is set in superscript on a poster that has been printed,
 * pinned up and handed out. If the site ever renumbers, the paper in
 * somebody's hand points at the wrong citation and nothing in the system can
 * detect that it has happened.
 *
 * So the number is stored per row and minted from a counter that only ever
 * grows, and the three properties below are the ones that keep it true:
 *
 *  1. **Delete-then-add never reuses a number.** The two obvious ways of
 *     working out the next number, `items.length + 1` and `max(n) + 1`, are
 *     both correct until a row is deleted and then both hand the deleted
 *     number to a different source. The counter is what makes the gap
 *     permanent.
 *  2. **A duplicate is refused.** Two rows sharing a number means one
 *     superscript on the poster points at two different things.
 *  3. **A gap survives a round trip.** A stored list of 1, 3 and 7 has to come
 *     back as 1, 3 and 7, with the counter still above all of them, or a
 *     reload quietly repairs the numbering into something the poster
 *     disagrees with.
 *
 * Reordering is tested alongside them because it is the operation most likely
 * to be mistaken for renumbering: it changes the order rows are READ in and
 * must leave every `n` exactly where it was.
 *
 * ## Why the loader
 *
 * The module under test is TypeScript and this repo's Node does not strip
 * types, so the graph is transpiled in memory by the shared loader in
 * `tests/lib/tsLoader.mjs`. It is registered in that suite's `USERS` map with
 * the reason, which is how a loader user stays visible.
