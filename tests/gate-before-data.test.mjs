/**
 * A ROUTE PROVES WHO IS CALLING BEFORE IT READS OR WRITES ANYTHING.
 *
 * WHY. The order of the first two things a handler does decides what an
 * unauthenticated probe learns. A route that validates its input before it
 * looks for a session tells a signed-out request whether the input was well
 * formed, when it should say nothing but 401. A route that reads a document,
 * and answers 404 or 400 from it, before the caller's right to know it exists
 * has been checked tells the caller whether the document is there. Each of
 * those is a small oracle; the class is "data before gate", and this guard
 * walks the tree for it.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS, per exported handler under `src/app/api`:
 *
 *  1. THE ORDER. The handler's calls are read in order. The first one that is
 *     a recognised gate (`GATES`, or a method in `METHOD_GATES`) has to come
 *     before the first one that touches Firestore (`.collection`, `.doc`,
 *     `.collectionGroup`, `.runTransaction`, `.batch`, `.getAll`,
 *     `.bulkWriter`). A helper defined in the same file is read the same way
 *     at the point it is called, so a gate wrapped in `requireEnroller()` or
 *     a secret compared inside `keyAccepted()` counts where the wrapper is
 *     called, and a helper that reads a document before the gate is a data
 *     touch where IT is called.
 *  2. EVERYTHING BEFORE THE GATE IS ACCOUNTED FOR. A call to a function
 *     imported from this repository that runs before the gate must be in
 *     `PURE`, with the reason it touches no document, and the claim is
 *     checked against the function's own body: an entry whose function
 *     contains a Firestore touch fails. A package import (`next/server`,
 *     `node:crypto`, `google-auth-library`) cannot reach this app's Firestore
 *     without the handle and is not classified.
 *  3. THE REFUSAL COMES FIRST TOO. When the gate is a session gate and the
 *     handler refuses a missing session at its top level, that refusal has to
 *     sit before the first data touch as well. A handler that resolves the
 *     session, reads the document and only then refuses has answered whether
 *     the document exists to a caller with no session.
 *  4. THE PUBLIC ROUTES ARE WRITTEN DOWN. A handler with no gate before its
 *     first touch is in `PUBLIC` with the reason and the literal that stands
 *     in for the gate (a throttle, a signed token verified inside a helper,
 *     a read that only ever returns published documents). Both directions:
 *     an entry whose handler has since gained a gate fails as stale.
 *
 * SCOPE. Per-document authorisation (is this caller on this event's
 * `collaboratorUids`) necessarily happens after the read; this guard asks only
 * that the caller's identity is established first.
 * `tests/authority-at-use.test.mjs` owns what happens with the array once it
 * is read, and `tests/public-write-gating.test.mjs` owns whether an anonymous
 * caller is refused at all. The source proof of a `PURE` entry reads the named
 * function's own body. The scanner's own reading is exercised on synthetic
 * handlers at the bottom of this file, so a pattern that quietly stopped
 * matching fails rather than passes.
