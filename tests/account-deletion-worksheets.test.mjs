/**
 * WHAT THE ACCOUNT CASCADE KEEPS, EXECUTED, AND THE ONE CHANNEL IT TAKES.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## Why a retention gets a test at all
 *
 * Every other suite around `accountDeletion.ts` proves that something GOES.
 * This one proves that three things STAY, which is the owner's decision of
 * 7 September 2026: a deleted account's worksheet responses and the staff
 * reviews of them remain, exactly as its tasks do, and the member record
 * (`memberRecords/{uid}/applications`) remains because it is the committee's
 * record about a person rather than that person's content.
 *
 * A retention is the kind of rule that decays silently. Nothing breaks the day
 * somebody adds a `circulations` sweep to the cascade: the deletion still
 * returns 200, the summary still reads clean, and the loss is noticed months
 * later by a committee looking for what was said about somebody who applied
 * twice. So the sweep is executed against a fake Firestore that records every
 * delete, and the test reads that list rather than trusting the summary.
 *
 * The counts get the same treatment, because a count is the one number that
 * looks identical whether it was measured or defaulted. `worksheetResponses`
 * is derived from the member's worksheet TASKS (the responses live under a
 * circulation and have no uid-keyed query), so the fixture includes a task of
 * another source and a worksheet task belonging to somebody else: a count that
 * dropped either filter would still look plausible.
 *
 * ## The one thing here that GOES
 *
 * The push subscription rows, which the owner decided on 7 September 2026 must
 * leave with the account. They are executed in this file rather than in a
 * suite of their own because this is the only fake Firestore that runs the
 * WHOLE cascade, and a sweep is worth nothing unpinned: a source read cannot
 * tell a delete that ran from a delete that was merely written. The two
 * concerns sit together on purpose: the retention tests below are what stop
 * that sweep growing into the circulations tree.
 *
 * Faked: `firebase-admin/firestore` (sentinels this store can interpret) and
 * `server-only`. The functions under test are the real ones, loaded through
 * the shared loader. Nothing here can reach a Firestore project.
