/**
 * A member's first day, end to end, in a real browser.
 *
 * The admin approves a waiting applicant on the real Approvals page -> a
 * second account takes the last place in the one-place session -> the new
 * member signs in -> reads their own subscription grid on /profile -> unticks
 * a channel and watches it stick -> drives the notification grid's column
 * master and its locked notices row -> measures that grid in the narrow band
 * where the sidebar comes back -> switches task email off and reads the
 * cell back off their document -> takes a place on the course -> meets the
 * full session when they try to move -> leaves the course -> and the two
 * emails the journey caused turn up in the send log.
 *
 * ## How to run it
 *
 *   npm run e2e:browser -- --spec member-journey --local    # a server it starts
 *
 * `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` seeds the throwaway world, leaves its ids in a state
 * file under `.e2e-state/` (or wherever E2E_STATE_DIR points), and tears
 * everything down afterwards.
 *
 * `sendEmail()` checks the suppression list for every send
 * (tests/email-suppression-chokepoint.test.mjs), so the fixture seeds against
 * a deployed target too and the mail step asserts that nothing left. See the
 * "Mail" section of scripts/e2e-fixtures/member-journey.mjs.
 *
 * ## It needs an admin account, and can never make one
 *
 * The first two steps are the whole reason this spec exists: role `member` is
 * a privilege, the harness is forbidden from writing one, and the only honest
 * way to have a member is for an admin to make one on the page a committee
 * actually uses. So it signs in as an admin account the harness is given (see
 * scripts/e2e/README.md), the runner refuses to seed without one, and this
 * file skips loudly when it is run on its own without one.
 *
 * ## THREE IDENTITIES, THREE CONTEXTS
 *
 * The admin, the new member, and the account that fills the one-place
 * session. Each gets its own browser context so its cookies and its Firebase
 * Auth client state are its own, and nobody has to be signed out for somebody
 * else to act. That matters here rather than being tidiness: the interesting
 * assertions are all about one identity seeing what another just did.
 *
 * ## CHROMIUM ONLY, and that is a limitation rather than a choice
 *
 * Playwright drives Chromium here and nothing else. This codebase has already
 * shipped a Safari-only defect (a `<button>` whose inline background WebKit
 * painted its own grey face over), and Google sign-in is not automatable at
 * all by design. So a green run here is a REGRESSION NET and never a
 * substitute for the manual Safari pass before dev goes to main.
 *
 * ## The headline guard: an empty subscriptions grid
 *
 * Steps five and six are the standing guard on #261. Firestore judges a query
 * by its shape rather than its results, and the rule grants a non-admin read
 * only on `audience == "user" && audienceId == auth.uid`: so a listener that
 * leaves out either clause is denied as a whole and every member's Email
 * preferences grid renders empty. The admin branch of the rule has no such
 * clause, which is exactly why this step is driven AS A MEMBER and the fixture
 * seeds rows that a working grid has to show.
 *
 * ## It writes a completion marker, and the runner insists on it
 *
 * Every way this file can decline to run (no Playwright, no fixture, a skip)
 * still exits `node --test` at 0. So the shared recorder records each step as
 * it finishes and writes the list in the `finally`; `scripts/run-e2e.mjs`
 * deletes that file before the run and refuses to report success unless it
 * comes back naming every step in `SPEC.steps`.
