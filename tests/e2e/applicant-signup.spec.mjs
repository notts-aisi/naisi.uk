/**
 * Joining NAISI from an apply link, end to end, in a real browser.
 *
 * The signed-out gate on /apply/[roundId] -> /login carrying the round as its
 * return address -> switch to Create account -> give an email -> read the
 * confirmation out of the inbox and drive its link -> set a password -> the
 * profile form -> verify a university email through a second emailed link ->
 * fill the form in -> land back on the apply page as a role-pending account
 * that is offered the application.
 *
 * The `__auth_next` cookie is deleted before the emailed link is driven, so
 * the last step proves the return address survives on the verification token
 * itself. That is the shape a real journey has: the confirmation email is
 * routinely opened on a phone, where no cookie of ours has ever existed.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is seeded except the round
 *
 * The fixture creates ONE admission round. The account is the product's to
 * make: `/api/register` creates the Auth user, the magic link verifies it and
 * mints the session, `/api/register/password-set` gives it a credential, and
 * the register form's own write creates `users/{uid}` at role `pending`. That
 * is the whole point of this spec, and it is why it cannot borrow the funnel's
 * seeded accounts: a seeded account would skip every one of those legs and
 * leave this proving that a form renders.
 *
 * ## LOCAL MODE ONLY, and that is a property rather than a limitation
 *
 * Two of the steps below make the server SEND, and the second send goes to an
 * `@nottingham.ac.uk` address, which is a real domain. So every step but the
 * first is on the fixture's `RECAPTCHA_DEPENDENT_STEPS` and is skipped against
 * a deployed target, and before the university address is typed anywhere the
 * spec PROVES a `.invalid` message really reached the local Mailpit. That is
 * the same gate scripts/e2e/tests/uni-email-inbox.test.mjs applies, for the
 * same reason: an env var saying "a runner started me" is a promise, and a
 * message sitting in the catcher is a fact.
 *
 * The register press additionally refuses to run at all unless the RUNNER said
 * this run's mail is caught. `http://127.0.0.1:3000` is on the harness target
 * allowlist and is the ordinary `npm run dev` port, whose mail is not
 * necessarily caught: loopback is not the same fact as caught, and this
 * spec is the one that would hand a real sender two fixture addresses.
 *
 * ## How to run it
 *
 *   npm run e2e:browser -- --local --spec applicant-signup
 *   E2E_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:3100 MAILPIT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8025 \
 *     node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --spec applicant-signup   # against a server
 *                                                        # already running
 *
 * ## CHROMIUM ONLY
 *
 * Playwright drives Chromium here and nothing else, and this codebase has
 * already shipped a Safari-only defect (a `<button>` whose inline background
 * WebKit painted its own grey face over). Google sign-in is not automatable at
 * all by design, so the Google half of this screen is untested by construction.
 * A green run is a REGRESSION NET, never a substitute for the manual Safari
 * pass before dev goes to main.
