/**
 * The public events RSVP flow, end to end, in a real browser, signed out.
 *
 * The event page -> fill the form including its custom question -> submit ->
 * the confirmation page -> the row, the counter and the email behind it ->
 * the same page at two phone viewports.
 *
 * ## Why this one is worth a browser
 *
 * `src/features/events/FormRenderer.tsx` was restructured in September 2026,
 * and it is shared: the same renderer paints the RSVP form, the change-request
 * form and the admissions application. `docs/mobile-baseline-events.md` calls
 * the public RSVP flow the site's hard do-not-regress mobile surface, records
 * that the baseline is walked BY HAND, and carries an owed re-verification
 * that nobody has cleared. So the two halves this file asserts are exactly the
 * two nobody has re-checked together since the restructure: that a guest can
 * still complete the form, and that the page still fits a phone.
 *
 * ## How to run it
 *
 *   npm run e2e:browser -- --spec events-rsvp            # deployed dev
 *   npm run e2e:browser -- --local --spec events-rsvp    # a server it starts
 *
 * `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` seeds the throwaway event, leaves its ids in a state
 * file under `.e2e-state/` (or wherever E2E_STATE_DIR points), and tears
 * everything down afterwards. Running this file on its own is supported
 * (`node --test tests/e2e/events-rsvp.spec.mjs`) but only once a seed exists:
 * it reads the state file and skips loudly when there is none.
 *
 * ## CHROMIUM ONLY, and that is a limitation rather than a choice
 *
 * Playwright drives Chromium here and nothing else. This codebase has already
 * shipped a Safari-only defect (a `<button>` whose inline background WebKit
 * painted its own grey face over), and the mobile baseline explicitly asks for
 * a real-device walk because DevTools does not model the notch inset or the
 * iOS keyboard. So the two viewport steps below are a REGRESSION NET on the
 * one thing a headless browser can answer honestly, which is layout geometry,
 * and they retire none of the hand walk in that document.
 *
 * ## The viewport steps assert, they do not compare screenshots
 *
 * A screenshot baseline of this surface would go red on a font swap, a date
 * that renders one character wider, and every deliberate copy change. The two
 * facts worth pinning are the two the baseline document states as rules: no
 * horizontal document scroll, and no clipped or covered control. Both are
 * measurable, so both are measured.
 *
 * ## It writes a completion marker, and the runner insists on it
 *
 * Every way this file can decline to run (no Playwright, no fixture, a skip)
 * still exits `node --test` at 0, which is indistinguishable from a pass. So
 * the shared recorder records each step as it finishes and writes the list in
 * the `finally`; `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` deletes that file before the run and
 * refuses to report success unless it comes back naming every step in
 * `SPEC.steps`.
