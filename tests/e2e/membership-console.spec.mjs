/**
 * The membership console, end to end, in a real browser.
 *
 * Sign in as an admin -> /admin/membership -> create a period -> make
 * it current -> look at it in the switcher -> find the seeded account in the
 * table -> record a tier -> read the row and the cached year in Firestore ->
 * take the membership away -> read that both are gone -> hand the current
 * pointer back where it came from.
 *
 * ## How to run it
 *
 *   E2E_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:3100 node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --spec membership-console
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --local --spec membership-console
 *
 * `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` seeds the throwaway world, leaves its ids in a state
 * file under `.e2e-state/`, and tears everything down afterwards. Running this
 * file on its own is supported once a seed exists; it reads the state file and
 * skips loudly when there is none.
 *
 * ## It signs in as an admin account it is given, because nothing else can
 *
 * The harness may never create an account above role `pending`, so the admin
 * is an account the harness is given (see scripts/e2e/README.md). Everything
 * this spec asserts about permissions is therefore asserted about a real
 * admin, and nothing here mints one.
 *
 * ## It moves a pointer the whole dev project reads, and says so
 *
 * "Make current" rewrites `config/membership`, which is what every membership
 * badge on dev reads while this runs. The fixture snapshotted that document
 * before the first write and puts it back in teardown, and its manifest counts
 * 1 for as long as the live pointer differs from the snapshot, so a run that
 * moved it and failed to move it back cannot report a clean total. The last
 * step below hands it back through the console as well, when there is a period
 * to hand it back to, because the console offering the way back is itself
 * worth proving.
 *
 * ## CHROMIUM ONLY, which is a limitation rather than a choice
 *
 * Playwright drives Chromium here and nothing else. This codebase has already
 * shipped a Safari-only defect (a `<button>` whose inline background WebKit
 * painted over), so a green run is a REGRESSION NET and never a substitute for
 * the manual Safari pass before dev goes to main.
