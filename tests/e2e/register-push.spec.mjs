/**
 * The attendance register, end to end, in a real browser.
 *
 * The group page -> mark all five states -> flip a session to not held -> write
 * a participant note -> push the first session -> press push again from a tab
 * that had not heard -> correct a pushed mark as an admin -> force the resend
 * -> read what actually went out.
 *
 * ## How to run it
 *
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --spec register-push --local
 *   E2E_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:3100 node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --spec register-push
 *
 * `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` seeds the throwaway world, leaves its ids in a state
 * file under `.e2e-state/` (or wherever E2E_STATE_DIR points), and tears
 * everything down afterwards. Running this file on its own is supported but
 * only once a seed exists: it reads the state file and skips loudly when there
 * is none.
 *
 * ## IT SIGNS IN AS AN ADMIN IT IS GIVEN, AND THAT IS THE POINT
 *
 * Every door onto a register is facilitator-or-admin, and this harness may not
 * appoint a facilitator (`facilitatorUids` is empty in the fixture, and the
 * fence in tests/funnel-harness-guards.test.mjs keeps it that way). So the
 * journey is the admin's, on the admin branch of the same gate.
 *
 * One consequence is worth stating rather than glossing: an admin's cells stay
 * EDITABLE after a push (`canEditPushed`), so this spec cannot watch the
 * facilitator's cells turn to stone. What it asserts instead is the boundary
 * itself, in three parts: the draft-only controls disappear from a pushed
 * column (counted before the push as well as after, so the check can fail);
 * the draft lane REFUSES a write to a pushed register even for this admin,
 * which the spec proves by issuing the POST the UI will not let it click and
 * reading the 409 back; and the admin's next correction travels the PATCH
 * lane, leaving an audit row saying who moved what.
 *
 * ## CHROMIUM ONLY
 *
 * Playwright drives Chromium here and nothing else, so a green run is a
 * regression net rather than a substitute for the manual Safari pass.
 *
 * ## It writes a completion marker, and the runner insists on it
 *
 * Every way this file can decline to run (no Playwright, no fixture, a skip)
 * still exits `node --test` at 0. The shared recorder records each step as it
 * finishes and writes the list in the `finally`; the runner refuses to report
 * success unless the marker names every step in `SPEC.steps`.
