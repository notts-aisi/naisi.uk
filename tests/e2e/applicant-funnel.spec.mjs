/**
 * The applicant funnel, end to end, in a real browser.
 *
 * Public course page -> the signed-out gate on /apply/[roundId] -> sign in ->
 * start a draft -> save -> reload and resume -> paint the availability grid ->
 * submit -> read the view-only state -> withdraw -> pick it back up -> submit
 * again -> the status hub -> take a pre-course seat -> leave the course.
 *
 * ## How to run it
 *
 *   npm run e2e:funnel            # against the deployed dev backend
 *   npm run e2e:funnel -- --local # against a server the run starts itself
 *
 * `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` seeds the throwaway world, leaves its ids in a state
 * file under `.e2e-state/` (or wherever E2E_STATE_DIR points), and tears
 * everything down afterwards. Running this file on its own is supported
 * (`node --test tests/e2e/applicant-funnel.spec.mjs`) but only once a seed
 * exists: it reads the state file and skips loudly when there is none.
 *
 * ## CHROMIUM ONLY, and that is a limitation rather than a choice
 *
 * Playwright drives Chromium here and nothing else. This codebase has already
 * shipped a Safari-only defect (a `<button>` whose inline background WebKit
 * painted its own grey face over), and Google sign-in is not automatable at
 * all by design. So a green run here is a REGRESSION NET and never a
 * substitute for the manual Safari pass before dev goes to main. Written on
 * the file because a note in a README is not read at 2am.
 *
 * ## Why it signs in with a password rather than a cookie
 *
 * A session cookie is enough for a server component. It is NOT enough here:
 * the session picker and the drop-out card are client islands reading
 * `useAuth()`, so a cookie alone leaves them in their signed-out branch and the
 * enrol leg would test nothing. The seeded accounts therefore carry a password
 * and this spec drives the real `/login` form, which leaves the browser with
 * real Firebase Auth client state AND the cookie the server wants.
 *
 * ## It writes a completion marker, and the runner insists on it
 *
 * Every way this file can decline to run (no Playwright, no fixture, a skip)
 * still exits `node --test` at 0, which is indistinguishable from a pass. So
 * the shared recorder in `scripts/e2e/lib/browser.mjs` records each step as it
 * finishes and writes the list in the `finally`; `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` deletes
 * that file before the run and refuses to report success unless it comes back
 * naming every step in `SPEC.steps` (the list lives in the fixture module, and
 * a guard test pins it against the step names below). A run that opened no
 * browser is a failure, loudly.
 *
 * ## It is one test with ordered steps, not thirteen tests
 *
 * The funnel is a sequence: there is no "withdraw" to check without a
 * submission before it. Independent tests would each have to rebuild the
 * state, which is both slower and a different thing to assert. Sub-tests give
 * the same named output without pretending the steps are independent.
