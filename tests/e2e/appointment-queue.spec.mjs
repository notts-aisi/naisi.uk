/**
 * The appointment queue, end to end, in a real browser.
 *
 * Sign in as an admin -> the round's appointment queue -> read both
 * applicants, their answers and when each can be in a room -> appoint the
 * first onto a run, through the confirm step -> decline the second, through
 * its own -> read both decisions, the facilitator and the audit line back out
 * of Firestore -> read the two emails out of the send log.
 *
 * ## How to run it
 *
 *   E2E_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:3100 node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --spec appointment-queue
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --local --spec appointment-queue
 *
 * `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` seeds the round, the run and the two submitted
 * applications, leaves their ids in a state file under `.e2e-state/`, and tears
 * everything down afterwards. Running this file on its own is supported once a
 * seed exists; it reads the state file and skips loudly when there is none.
 *
 * ## Neither button decides on one press, and this spec presses both halves
 *
 * An appointment writes a uid onto a run and mails the person; a decline mails
 * them too; and the route refuses to overwrite either afterwards, because the
 * email has already gone. So each press opens a confirm step that names the
 * person and the run, and this spec goes through it rather than around it: the
 * confirm step is the safety, and a spec that reached past it would be proving
 * a journey nobody takes.
 *
 * ## The applications are seeded, not applied for
 *
 * The apply routes are reCAPTCHA-gated and are the applicant funnel's job. This
 * spec is about the decider's screen, so the fixture writes the two submitted
 * applications in the shape those routes leave behind, and everything from the
 * queue onwards is driven for real. That is what lets this run against a
 * deployed target as well as a local one.
 *
 * ## CHROMIUM ONLY, which is a limitation rather than a choice
 *
 * Playwright drives Chromium here and nothing else, so a green run is a
 * REGRESSION NET and never a substitute for the manual Safari pass before dev
 * goes to main.
