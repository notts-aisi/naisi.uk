/**
 * Round authoring, end to end, in a real browser.
 *
 * Sign in as the admin -> the admissions console -> New round -> the editor,
 * with six things still to do -> standfirst -> deadline and decision date ->
 * a required long-text question -> an outcome run -> a reviewer and a final
 * decider -> the panel goes green -> open it -> the public apply page shows
 * it and gates a signed-out visitor -> close it -> the public form shuts ->
 * take the reviewer and the decider back off.
 *
 * ## How to run it
 *
 *   npm run e2e:browser -- --spec round-authoring            # deployed dev
 *   npm run e2e:browser -- --local --spec round-authoring    # its own server
 *
 * `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` seeds the throwaway world (one course, one run: see
 * `scripts/e2e-fixtures/round-authoring.mjs` for why that is all), leaves its
 * ids in a state file under `.e2e-state/`, and tears everything down
 * afterwards. Running this file on its own is supported but only once a seed
 * exists: it reads the state file and skips loudly when there is none.
 *
 * ## It signs in as an admin it is given, and appoints nobody new
 *
 * The harness may not create an account above role `pending`, so the admin is
 * an account it is given (see scripts/e2e/README.md). The
 * one place that matters beyond the sign-in is the reviewer picker: appointing
 * somebody writes `users.admissionsReviewer` on a REAL account, so this spec
 * appoints an ADMIN (who already holds every power the appointment grants) and
 * refuses to appoint an SU-recognised committee member, and its last step
 * takes the appointment back off through the same picker, which is what makes
 * the route clear the flag again. The fixture module says the rest.
 *
 * ## CHROMIUM ONLY, and that is a limitation rather than a choice
 *
 * Playwright drives Chromium here and nothing else. This codebase has already
 * shipped a Safari-only defect (a `<button>` whose inline background WebKit
 * painted its own grey face over), and the console is nothing but buttons. So
 * a green run here is a REGRESSION NET and never a substitute for the manual
 * Safari pass before dev goes to main.
 *
 * ## It is one test with ordered steps, not eleven tests
 *
 * Authoring a round is a sequence: there is no "open it" to check without the
 * six readiness items before it, and no public page to read without the open.
 * Independent tests would each have to rebuild the round through the same
 * eleven presses, which is both slower and a different thing to assert.
