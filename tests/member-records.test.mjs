/**
 * The member record's pure halves: `buildApplicationRecord` (what an entry
 * says) and `normalizeApplicationRecord` (what survives a read), plus a source
 * pin that nothing client-side writes the collection.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * ## Why these two functions are executed rather than reasoned about
 *
 * An entry is the one thing a destroy is required to leave behind, and it
 * OUTLIVES EVERYTHING IT WAS DERIVED FROM. Once the round, the applications
 * and the reviews are gone there is nothing left to check it against, so a
 * mistake in the derivation is not a bug that gets found later: it is the
 * committee's permanent record of what somebody applied for and how it went,
 * quietly wrong. The arithmetic (which reviewers count towards a mean, what an
 * unscored review contributes) and the labels (what the person asked for, who
 * wrote which note) are therefore assertions rather than comments.
 *
 * ## What the source pin is for
 *
 * The write side of this collection is `allow write: if false` for every
 * client, admins included, and the rules suite proves that against the
 * emulator. This pin proves the other direction, at the source: no file under
 * `src/features` or `src/app/(app)` writes `memberRecords`, so nobody has
 * shipped a client-direct write that the deployed rules would refuse at
 * runtime, silently, on a surface nobody tests as a member. A read there is
 * fine and is expected: the rules grant one to admins and SU-recognised
 * committee on purpose.
