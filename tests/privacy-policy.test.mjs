/**
 * The current privacy policy, the frozen versions behind it, and the
 * re-consent gate that publishing a new one fires.
 *
 * Run with `npm test`.
 *
 * The current version is v5 (7 September 2026): v4's text plus the
 * notification grid's four passages (the four rows and the two choices per
 * row, a notification chosen separately from its email, important notices
 * under performance of a contract, and no unsubscribe link on them). v4 is
 * the wording members accepted at the 6 September 2026 release and is frozen
 * below. Before that, v4 was v3 plus one sentence, under "When you join the
 * committee", about what a circulated worksheet records; that sentence was
 * first edited straight into v3, which was the wrong move and is the reason
 * §1b below exists. A version the owner has
 * accepted is frozen text. Editing it changes what somebody sees at the
 * archive URL for the wording they agreed to, and it changes it WITHOUT moving
 * CURRENT_POLICY_VERSION, so nobody is ever asked to accept the new sentence.
 * New wording goes in a new file, every time.
 *
 * A policy version is a promise, and the four ways it can quietly become a
 * lie are all pinned here:
 *
 *  1. **The section stops being exhaustive.** v4's "Courses and programmes"
 *     section is the one place the platform tells an applicant what it holds
 *     about them. A later PR that adds a category and forgets the policy has
 *     made the page wrong, so every category the courses hub holds is checked
 *     for by name. These are keyword checks over the rendered copy, which is
 *     coarse on purpose: they cannot judge wording (that is the owner's, see
 *     the OWNER TO CONFIRM block at the top of the file), only that the
 *     subject is addressed at all.
 *  2. **An archived version is edited in place.** Every published version
 *     stays readable at /privacy/v/N, and the only honest way to change a
 *     sentence is a new version. §1b holds EVERY version behind the current
 *     one to a sha256 of its bytes, so any edit to any of them fails here
 *     rather than sitting on an archive page nobody rereads. The digest list
 *     and POLICIES are checked against each other in both directions, which
 *     means publishing v5 cannot happen without freezing v4 in the same
 *     change: that is exactly the moment somebody is meant to stop editing
 *     it. The two phrases from the edit that already happened are pinned
 *     underneath as the named case, because a digest failure only says "this
 *     file changed" and the named case says what changed last time.
 *  3. **A pointer goes on naming last version's file.** Prose in `src` and
 *     `docs` that sends a reader to a version file is how the previous
 *     mistake was invited: a comment saying "keep this in step with v3.tsx"
 *     is an instruction to edit accepted text. §1c walks both trees and fails
 *     any pointer that names a version other than the current one.
 *  4. **The gate stops firing.** Moving CURRENT_POLICY_VERSION is what asks
 *     members to re-accept, and the gate has to be somewhere every authed page
 *     passes through, must not run inside a view-as session, and must still
 *     name a version the site can render.
 *
 * The registry check is the fifth: a version listed in POLICIES with no
 * content component is a 404 or a crash on its archive URL, and the version
 * history page links to every one of them. It runs over every policy in
 * POLICIES, not privacy alone, so a second terms version is covered the day
 * it lands rather than the day somebody remembers.

/**
 * Every published version that is no longer current, with a sha256 of the file
 * as it is accepted and one line saying whose agreement it records.
 *
 * ## Why a digest and not a list of sentences
 *
 * The failure this closes is "a version the owner accepted was edited in
 * place", and the shape it took was one sentence added to v3 while v3 was
 * live. Pinning that sentence catches that sentence. It does not catch the
 * next one, or a word changed in v1, and the whole point of an archive is
 * that a reader can go back to what they agreed to and find it there. A
 * digest over the file's bytes is the only check that covers every edit,
 * including the ones nobody thought of when this was written.
 *
 * ## Both directions, and what that buys
 *
 * The keys here and the non-current entries in POLICIES are compared as sets.
 * So publishing v5 fails this file until v4's digest is added, and adding a
 * digest for a version that is still current, or for a file that is not
 * there, fails too. That is deliberate: the moment a version stops being
 * current is exactly the moment people stop being asked about changes to it,
 * and it is therefore the moment to nail it down. Freezing it is one command
 * (`shasum -a 256 src/content/legal/<policy>/v<N>.tsx`) at the one point in
 * the process where somebody is already thinking about versions.
 *
 * ## When a digest legitimately changes
 *
 * Almost never, and never for wording. The only honest reasons are changes
 * that cannot alter what the page says (a rename of an imported component, a
 * lint rule reformatting the file). Update the digest in the same commit as
 * that change, say so in the commit message, and check the rendered copy is
 * identical. Anything that changes a word needs a new version instead.

// §4 The access-requirements read log: the promise, and the guard on it
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * v4 tells an applicant, twice, that their access-requirements answer is
 * stored apart, is never scored, and that "every time one of them does we
 * record who read it". The in-form notice says the same thing on the page
 * where the answer is typed.
 *
 * The `access-requirements-read` audit kind in `CourseAuditKind` is what a
 * staff route that reveals the answer records each read under, so the
 * sentence is a promise about that route, which is exactly the shape of claim
 * a policy quietly breaks.
 *
 * This guard is what keeps it honest. It walks EVERY route file under
 * src/app/api and refuses one that reaches `admissionApplicationPrivate` (by
 * collection name, through the shared id helper, or through the apply tree's
 * shared context module, which addresses the collection on a route's behalf)
 * without also naming the audit kind. A reveal route that forgets the log
 * cannot ship, so the two always land together and the policy stays true.
 *
 * A route that only DELETES these rows should go through
 * `accountDeletion.ts` rather than naming the collection itself, which is
 * what the account-deletion cascade already does.
 *
 * ## The owner lane, and why it is exempt
 *
 * The promise the policy makes is about somebody ELSE reading the answer:
 * "only the person making the final decision and site admins can open it, and
 * every time one of them does we record who read it". The applicant's own
 * apply routes read the row back to put the applicant's own words in their own
 * textarea, which is not a disclosure to anybody and is not what the sentence
 * is about. Logging it would also drown the real audit: a two-minute autosave
 * writes and reads the row on every cycle, so one applicant writing an essay
 * would generate more rows than the whole decision week.
 *
 * The exemption is therefore a NAMED LIST, not a pattern. Each entry is a
 * route that may address the collection only in the owner's own lane, and
 * adding one is a decision somebody made rather than a wildcard a later route
 * slides through. Every entry is checked to still exist, so a rename shows up
 * here rather than silently widening the allowance.
 *
 * ## What "the owner's own lane" rests on, and the one thing that breaks it
 *
 * The whole exemption is the claim that the session the route reads from IS
 * the person whose answer it is. Admin "view as" is the one mechanism on this
 * site that makes that claim false: it swaps the `__session` cookie for the
 * TARGET's, so `getCurrentUser()` returns the member and the doc id the route
 * builds is the member's. Without a guard the owner lane would hand an admin
 * somebody's disability and health information with nothing recording the
 * read, and the exemption would be laundering exactly the disclosure the
 * policy sentence is about.
 *
 * So every entry below calls `assertNotImpersonating()` before it touches the
 * collection, and the test after this list checks that rather than trusting
 * the prose. The server-rendered `/apply/[roundId]` page is the same lane
 * without a route handler in it, and it answers the same question its own way:
 * it checks the marker and omits the private join, which is pinned in
 * `tests/admissions-apply-flow.test.mjs`.
