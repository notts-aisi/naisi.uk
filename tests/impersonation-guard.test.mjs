/**
 * View-as write guard (run via `npm test`, Node's built-in test runner). Two
 * halves: a source scan over the guarded route trees, and, at the foot of the
 * file, live calls into `assertNotImpersonating()` itself through a transpiled
 * copy of the module with its request-only imports stubbed.
 *
 * Admin "view as" is a FULL impersonation: the `__session` cookie is swapped
 * for the target's, so `getCurrentUser()` returns the target and Firestore
 * records every write as the target performing it. For a debug tool that
 * exists to answer "what does this member see", that is fine on reads and
 * unacceptable on anything that decides, allocates, publishes, removes, marks
 * attendance, reviews work, sends email, changes status or destroys.
 *
 * So every mutating route under the trees below calls
 * `assertNotImpersonating()` before it does anything else. This test is what
 * keeps that true as the trees grow: a new route added to one of
 * those trees fails here until it either calls the guard or is added to
 * ALLOWLIST with a reason a reader can weigh.
 *
 * The route list is written out in full rather than derived, so the guard is
 * legible as a list of decisions and a deletion shows up as a diff.
 *
 * SCOPE, restated from `assertNotImpersonating()`: this covers mutating route
 * handlers in the listed trees, and `(app)/admin/layout.tsx` separately closes
 * the whole admin page tree during a view-as session because the course
 * editors there write client-direct, where no route guard can reach. A new
 * surface that writes client-direct needs its page tree closed the same way,
 * or its writes routed through a guarded handler. The marker is an httpOnly
 * cookie, which no page script can remove.
