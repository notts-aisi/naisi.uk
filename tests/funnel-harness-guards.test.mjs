/**
 * Offline guards on the BROWSER end-to-end harness (run under `npm test` - no
 * network, no credentials, no dev project involved).
 *
 * `tests/e2e-no-privilege-grants.test.mjs` fences the AUTH harness into three
 * Firestore collections. A browser fixture cannot live inside that fence (it
 * seeds admission rounds, course runs, events and membership periods), so it
 * sits outside it with a fence of its own, and this file is that fence. The
 * properties are the same three the auth harness holds, because they are the
 * properties dev needs:
 *
 *   1. It can never be aimed at production.
 *   2. It never grants a privilege. Its accounts are role `pending`, the
 *      lowest role there is, written by the auth harness's own seeder.
 *   3. It only ever addresses collections on its own declared list.
 *
 * Property 1 is tested BEHAVIOURALLY, by calling the real `assertTarget()` and
 * the fixture's own `assertFixtureTarget()`. Properties 2 and 3 are source
 * greps over the harness's own files.
 *
 * A fourth property is specific to this harness and is why the file exists at
 * all rather than the fixtures being bolted onto the older guard: a browser
 * SPEC drives a live target, so the file that decides which target must be the
 * allowlist rather than a raw string.
 *
 * ## It WALKS the harness rather than listing it
 *
 * Six specs land on this scaffold at once, and a hand-written file list is a
 * list that goes stale on the first of them. So every check below runs over a
 * walk of `scripts/e2e-fixtures/`, `scripts/run-e2e.mjs`,
 * `scripts/seed-fake-applicants.mjs` and `tests/e2e/`, and the walk itself is
 * asserted to have found the four files that must always be in it, so an empty
 * or mis-rooted walk cannot pass by covering nothing.
