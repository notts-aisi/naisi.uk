/**
 * Short links: `naisi.uk/q/<slug>` answered from a record an admin can repoint.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * The codes this route answers are PRINTED. They were answered by redirects in
 * `next.config.ts` until the route took over, and the whole risk of that swap
 * is a code that used to work and now does not. So the centre of this file is
 * the table below, recorded from production on the night before the swap, and
 * run through the shipping route against a fake database:
 *
 *  1. EVERY PRINTED CODE ANSWERS EXACTLY AS IT DID. Same status, same
 *     `Location`, byte for byte, with no record in the database at all and
 *     with the database refusing to answer. That is the promise that a code
 *     somebody paid to print keeps working.
 *  2. NOTHING CAN SHADOW THE ROUTE. Next matches a redirect before a rewrite
 *     and before the filesystem, so a `/q/<slug>` redirect left in the config
 *     would take over silently: nothing errors, and repointing a code in the
 *     console does nothing. The config is read and every `/q` entry checked.
 *  3. IT IS NOT AN OPEN REDIRECTOR. A destination comes from the record and
 *     never from the request, and passes `parseDestination` on save and again
 *     on every scan. The refused shapes are written out.
 *  4. THE LOCATION IS RELATIVE AND BUILT BY HAND. Behind the hosting proxy
 *     `req.url` carries an internal host, so a `Location` built from it would
 *     work on a laptop and send every code to a dead address in production.
 *  5. THE GET NEVER COUNTS. Held from both sides: `recordScan` is refused by
 *     `tests/get-handlers-readonly.test.mjs`, and nothing the GET imports may
 *     import the counter.
