/**
 * The admin permissions editor writes the WHOLE `permissions` map, so any key
 * it forgets is a permission the next edit silently revokes.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `setPermissions` shipped rebuilding a four-key
 * object (the newsletter and event pair) while `UserPermissions` had grown to
 * six: an admin toggling somebody's newsletter permission destroyed their
 * `draftCourse` and `approveCourse` grants, with no warning and no way to
 * notice short of re-reading the Firestore document.
 *
 * The write is a client-direct `updateDoc`, so there is no route to test and
 * no emulator seam either: the mutation and the type live in two files and the
 * only thing that can hold them together is a source pin. Like
 * `e2e-no-privilege-grants.test.mjs`, this is a deliberate speed bump rather
 * than a proof, and it is aimed at the specific mistake that has already been
 * made once.
 *
 * WHEN THIS FAILS: a key was added to `UserPermissions` and not to
 * `PERMISSION_KEYS`, or the other way round. Add it to both, then give it a
 * control in `MemberItem` so it can actually be granted.
