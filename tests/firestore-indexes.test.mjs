/**
 * Composite-index guard (run via `npm test`, Node's built-in runner, no
 * emulator, no credentials, no network).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The Firestore emulator does not enforce indexes: every
 * query it is handed succeeds, whatever `firestore.indexes.json` says. So the
 * emulator suite in `scripts/rules-tests/` is structurally unable to see a
 * missing index, and the failure mode it cannot see is the worst kind we
 * ship: a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` that appears only in real Firestore, only on
 * the code path that carries the filter, and only after deploy.
 *
 * The clearest case:
 * `collectionGroup("rows").where("matchedUid", "==", uid)` in
 * `src/lib/firestore/accountDeletion.ts` needs the `rows.matchedUid` field
 * override at COLLECTION_GROUP scope, because the automatic single-field
 * indexes Firestore maintains for free are COLLECTION-scoped only.
 * `tests/account-deletion-memberships.test.mjs` pins that one override by
 * hand. This file generalises it: it reads every Firestore query in `src/`
 * and `scripts/`, works out from the documented index rules whether the query
 * needs a declared index, and fails when one is missing.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS, in three parts.
 *
 *  1. A source scanner walks the trees, resolves collection names and field
 *     names to literals the way `tests/courses-draft-reads.test.mjs` does
 *     (extended to object constants such as `SITE_NOTICE_PATH.collection` and
 *     to chains built up across statements), and produces a query shape per
 *     call site: collection, collection-group flag, filter fields and
 *     operators, orderBy fields and directions.
 *  2. `INDEX_RULES` encodes what Cloud Firestore's current documentation says
 *     about when an index is owed, one entry per rule with the sentence it
 *     came from. Nothing here is written from memory of how Firestore used to
 *     behave; where the docs are silent, the entry says so.
 *  3. The two are matched. A query that needs an index and has none fails the
 *     test, naming the file, the line, the collection, the shape and the JSON
 *     stanza that would satisfy it. A declared index no query matches is
 *     reported as a warning, because a stale index costs storage and write
 *     latency but breaks nothing.
 *
 * SCOPE, and the one deliberate exclusion. `src/` and `scripts/` are both in,
 * client SDK and Admin SDK alike, because an index is a property of the
 * database and does not care which SDK asks. `scripts/rules-tests/` is OUT:
 * that package talks only to the Firestore emulator (see its README), where
 * indexes do not exist and a query that would fail in production passes.
 * `scripts/e2e/` is IN: `scripts/e2e/lib/firestore.mjs` takes its handle from
 * `getFirestore(adminApp())` with no emulator-host branch anywhere in the
 * file, so its queries run against a real database with real index
 * requirements.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE. It reads source text, not a running query planner. A
 * collection name or filter field assembled at runtime is not resolvable by
 * reading the file, so those sites are named in `UNRESOLVED_SITES` with the
 * concrete shapes their callers pass and the reason each is safe. That list is
 * checked in both directions: a new unresolved site with no entry fails, and
 * an entry matching no site fails, so it cannot rot into decoration.

 * a guard checking a query against the wrong collection's indexes and saying
 * nothing, which is worse than no guard.
