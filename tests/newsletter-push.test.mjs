/**
 * THE NEWSLETTER'S PUSH LEG, AND THE ENUMERATION IT SHARES, executed.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials, no
 * network). `tests/notification-classification.test.mjs` says this send is the
 * grid class on the newsletter row and reads the tree to check the claim;
 * `tests/push-preferences.test.mjs` proves the row's copy describes something
 * that exists. This file runs the code and checks what those claims are worth.
 *
 * ## What is worth executing, and why a source grep would not do
 *
 *  1. **The cell is honoured, per row, from one world.** The same seeded
 *     Firestore is pushed for `newsletter` and for `events` and the two reach
 *     DIFFERENT people, which is the whole of what the row parameter is for. A
 *     grep can see `wantsPushFor(uid, row)` in the helper; only running it can
 *     show that the row travelled from the call site to the answer.
 *  2. **Absent means off here.** Both rows this helper serves are opt-in, so a
 *     member who has never touched the switches must not be notified for owning
 *     a phone. That is the difference between this producer and the task and
 *     course mirrors, and it is the reason the helper refuses the opt-out rows
 *     at the type level.
 *  3. **A device whose owner has no user document.** `wantsPushFor` answers
 *     that branch with the row's default, which is off for both rows this
 *     helper serves. This producer enumerates DEVICES, so it reaches that
 *     branch for every stale row, and a stale row must not be pushed a
 *     newsletter nobody opted in to. Executed against a device with no owner,
 *     per row.
 *  4. **The ceiling refuses whole.** Over `MAX_PUSH_ROWS` nothing is pushed at
 *     all and the refusal is logged. A truncation would notify an arbitrary
 *     prefix of the audience and report success, so "nothing was sent" is the
 *     assertion, not "some of it was".
 *  5. **`pushed` counts notifications, not calls.** A member whose cell is on
 *     and whose only device the push service has forgotten is not somebody who
 *     was told. Driven through the real `sendPushToUid`, so the 410-and-prune
 *     path decides the count rather than the test asserting its own arithmetic.
 *  6. **The route, end to end.** The push happens once per send, the response
 *     and the draft carry the count, and a push leg that cannot read its
 *     collection leaves a delivered newsletter answering 200. A newsletter that
 *     has reached four hundred inboxes and then 500s is an invitation to send
 *     it again.
 *  7. **The send claim, under a race.** Two POSTs are fired at once and exactly
 *     one of them sends: the status check at the top of the route cannot
 *     separate them, because both read the draft before either wrote to it, so
 *     only the transaction can. Executed rather than reasoned about. The
 *     interrupted case is here too: a standing claim refuses the retry and
 *     changes nothing.
 *  8. **The unsubscribe link reaches both cells of a subscription row.** The
 *     footer link and Gmail's one-click button are a refusal of the ROW, and a
 *     member who clicks one must stop getting the notification as well as the
 *     email. `courses` is the deliberate exception, because its two cells gate
 *     different messages: executed per row rather than asserted once.
 *  9. **The test send stays transactional**, pinned from its source: it must
 *     reach neither the shared enumeration nor a push preference.
 *
 * ## The fakes
 *
 * A fake Firestore, not the emulator, and a fake `web-push`: `npm test` must
 * not reach a project and must never put a notification on the wire. The push
 * pipeline itself (`lib/push/send.ts`, `lib/push/store.ts`) and the preference
 * read are REAL, so the outcome mapping, the pruning and the row defaults are
 * measured rather than restated. The VAPID keys are environment variables, set
 * here, which is also how the dormant case is exercised: unset them and the
 * helper must not read a collection at all.
