/**
 * Unit tests for the scheduler's pure logic:
 *   - `src/lib/firestore/schedulerRuns.ts`  (the receipt id scheme)
 *   - `src/lib/firestore/schedulerMarkers.ts` (marker ids + the re-claim rule)
 * plus source-level guards on `src/app/api/scheduler/tick/route.ts` for the
 * two properties that are policy rather than logic (404 not 401, and an
 * explicit maxDuration under the platform timeout).
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## Why there is a loader dance at the top
 *
 * Same reason as tests/week-plan.test.mjs: this repo's Node is v20, which
 * cannot import a `.ts` file, so the modules are transpiled in memory with
 * the `typescript` devDependency. Both modules under test are deliberately
 * free of RUNTIME imports (they use `import type` only) so a standalone
 * transpile has nothing to resolve. Keep them that way, or this suite starts
 * failing with an unresolved specifier rather than with a real assertion.
 *
 * ## What is being pinned
 *
 * 1. THE DEPTH SUFFIX. `tick__{bucket}` alone was fatal: the self re-arm
 *    fires seconds after its parent, floors to the SAME 15-minute bucket,
 *    hits ALREADY_EXISTS and returns having done nothing, so depth could
 *    never leave 0 and a backlog waited a full 15 minutes. The tests below
 *    model both halves: two depth-0 deliveries in one bucket collapse onto
 *    one receipt, and a depth-1 re-arm in that same bucket does not.
 *
 * 2. THE RE-CLAIM BOUNDARY. Exactly at `reclaimAfterMinutes` a marker is
 *    still in flight; past it, it is reclaimable. Reclaiming ON the equality
 *    is how a rounded millisecond turns into two sends.
 *
 * 3. GIVING UP AT THREE. A marker that has been claimed three times without
 *    a stamp stops being retried automatically and becomes a visible failure.
 *    Without the cap the tick loops on it forever; without the visibility the
 *    send is silently gone.
