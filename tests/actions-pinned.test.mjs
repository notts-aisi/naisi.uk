/**
 * Two guards on the GitHub Actions workflows (run via `npm test`, Node's
 * built-in test runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * 1. EVERY ACTION IS PINNED TO A COMMIT. `uses: actions/checkout@v4` names a
 *    tag, and a tag is a pointer its owner can move: whoever controls that
 *    repository, or steals a maintainer's token, repoints `v4` and the next
 *    run here executes their code with this run's token and secrets.
 *    A full commit SHA cannot be repointed, so every `uses:` must name one,
 *    with the release it corresponds to in a trailing comment
 *    (`@<40 hex> # v4.4.0`). The comment is what a reviewer reads, and it is
 *    what Dependabot rewrites when it bumps the pin, so it is required too.
 *    The repository setting "Require actions to be pinned to a full-length
 *    commit SHA" enforces the same thing at run time; this fails earlier, on
 *    the pull request that would break it, and says which line.
 *
 * 2. EVERY JOB'S TOKEN IS SCOPED. Without a `permissions:` block a job gets
 *    whatever the repository default is. Each workflow must declare one at the
 *    top level, or every one of its jobs must declare its own.
 *
 * Both walk every workflow file and every local composite action, so a new
 * workflow is covered without anyone remembering this file exists. A line the
 * reader below cannot classify fails rather than being skipped.
