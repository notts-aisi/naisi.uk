/**
 * Unit tests for the WEEKLY COURSE NUDGE — the send-dedupe marker
 * (`src/lib/email/courseNudgeEmail.ts`), the token resolver's degradation
 * rules, and the four-way token contract the admin designer proofs against.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * P10 shipped `course-task-mirror.test.mjs` for exactly this class of
 * guarantee: a property the source carries paragraphs about and nothing
 * executed. P11 has two of them.
 *
 *  1. **The marker.** It is what stands between a misconfigured cron and a
 *     cohort receiving the same email seven times. It is keyed on the CALENDAR
 *     SLOT rather than the display week number, and that choice is the whole
 *     defence against a track lead renumbering the week plan mid-week — an edit
 *     that would otherwise mint a fresh marker and re-mail everyone. Nothing
 *     type-checks that; a test has to.
 *  2. **The degradation rules.** A cohort must never receive
 *     "Your group meets {sessionWhen}, {sessionWhere}.", a paragraph reading
 *     "{weekPrep}", or a dead link whose href is the string "{weekUrl}". The
 *     renderer's answer is to drop a text unit whose tokens ALL resolved empty
 *     and tidy the punctuation of the mixed case. That is an exact rule over a
 *     seed template with six paragraphs and ten tokens, so the matrix below
 *     renders all 2^10 combinations and asserts the invariants on every one.
 *
 * ## Why the loader dance is bigger than the task mirror's
 *
 * Same root cause: this repo's Node predates the v22.18 that strips TypeScript
 * natively, so `loadTsGraph` transpiles in memory with the `typescript`
 * devDependency `npx tsc --noEmit` already uses. Three differences from
 * `course-task-mirror.test.mjs`, all forced by the module under test:
 *
 *  - **`@/…` alias resolution.** `courseNudgeEmail.ts` imports by alias, and a
 *    `data:` URL can resolve neither a relative path nor an alias.
 *  - **THREE STUBBED SPECIFIERS**, listed in `STUBS` with the reason each is
 *    unreachable from an assertion here. Everything the tests actually call is
 *    the real module: the real `courseTemplateDefaults`, the real `firstWord`,
 *    the real `weekPlan` maths, the real `courseSampleTokens`.
 *  - **The transpile path is taken unconditionally**, not as a fallback. On a
 *    Node new enough to import `.ts` directly, a native import would bypass the
 *    rewrites and load `server-only`, which throws by design outside a React
 *    Server Component graph.
 *
 * Delete the dance once the repo's Node is >= 22.18 AND `server-only` can be
 * resolved to its no-op build from a plain script.
