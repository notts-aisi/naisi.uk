/**
 * The admissions deadline reminders: the due-date maths, and the job that
 * hangs off it.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## What is worth executing here
 *
 *  1. **The due instants.** Every reminder date is derived at tick time from
 *     `closesAt` minus an offset, moved to a London wall clock. Getting that
 *     wrong by an hour is invisible in April and wrong for half the year, so
 *     the BST and GMT cases are both executed rather than reasoned about.
 *  2. **The marker key.** It is the RESOLVED CIVIL DATE, never the offset id,
 *     and that single decision is what makes editing a round's schedule safe
 *     and what collapses two same-day offsets onto one email. Both halves are
 *     asserted directly.
 *  3. **The order of operations.** Claim, then send, then stamp. The fake
 *     below inspects the marker FROM INSIDE the send, which is the only way
 *     to prove the claim really precedes the send rather than merely
 *     appearing earlier in the file.
 *  4. **The ceiling and the stale rule**, because both are policies about
 *     what NOT to do, and a policy nobody executes is a comment.
 *  5. **The stored schedule.** A round carries a free list of reminder slots,
 *     not three fixed ids, so the normaliser has to keep a slot nobody has
 *     seen before, keep an empty list empty, and read a round written before
 *     the free list existed exactly as it read it then.
 *
 * ## The fake Firestore
 *
 * A double, not the emulator: `npm test` has no emulator and must not reach a
 * project. It implements the six things the handler uses (doc get, doc
 * create, doc set with merge, an equality query with a limit and a cursor, a
 * transaction, and a resolving server timestamp) and nothing else. The email
 * send, the suppression list and the Admin SDK are stubbed at the module
 * boundary, so no test in this file can put mail on the wire.
