/**
 * Unit tests for the FIRESTORE half of the marker lifecycle:
 * `src/lib/scheduler/markers.ts`: `claim`, `stampSent`, `stampError`,
 * `stampSkipped` and `retryFailedMarker`.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists alongside tests/scheduler.test.mjs
 *
 * That suite pins the PURE half: the marker id scheme and
 * `decideMarkerClaim`, the function that answers "claim, skip or give up".
 * Everything that makes the answer stick lives here instead, and none of it
 * is expressible as a pure function:
 *
 *  - the FAST PATH is a `.create()`, and the whole no-duplicate-send property
 *    rests on that call being atomic. A `.set()` would be silently wrong.
 *  - the SLOW PATH re-runs the same decision inside a transaction, because
 *    two ticks that both saw one stale marker must not both send. The
 *    decision function cannot enforce that on its own; the transaction can.
 *  - `retryFailedMarker` is the one write an ADMIN triggers, and it must
 *    refuse a marker that already went out (a "retry" would be a duplicate)
 *    and a marker still in flight (a "retry" would race a live send).
 *
 * ## The fake Firestore
 *
 * A double, not the emulator: this suite runs in `npm test`, which has no
 * emulator and must not reach a project. It implements exactly the four
 * behaviours the code under test depends on, and nothing else:
 *
 *  1. `.create()` throws `code 6` when the document is already there, the
 *     ALREADY_EXISTS that means somebody else owns this unit of work;
 *  2. `.set(..., { merge: true })` merges;
 *  3. `runTransaction` REPLAYS its body when a document it read changed
 *     underneath it, which is the property the concurrent-re-claim test is
 *     actually about;
 *  4. `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` resolves to the fake's clock at write
 *     time, so a re-claimed marker's `claimedAt` really does move.
 *
 * ## The loader
 *
 * The shared one, `tests/lib/tsLoader.mjs`: this repo's Node is v20 and cannot
 * import `.ts`, so each module is transpiled in memory with the `typescript`
 * devDependency and `@/…` is resolved by hand. It compiles JSX, which matters
 * here because `registry.ts` imports every job by value and several of those
 * jobs reach an email template.

 * The stubs.

 * entries below arrived with the REAL jobs in the registry, and they are
 * doors to the outside world rather than logic: the registry imports its job
 * modules by value (that is how a registration is a registration), so loading
 * `registry.ts` here loads every job, and the reminders job reaches the Resend
 * send path and the Admin SDK. They are stubbed so this suite cannot put mail
 * on the wire, NOT because of the email templates behind them: the shared
 * loader compiles those.
 *
 * The last two arrived with the worksheet due-soon reminders, which is the
 * first tick job that also PUSHES. The push mirror's own graph reaches
 * `push/store.ts`, which imports `Timestamp` as a value, and a missing named
 * export is a link error rather than a runtime one, so the mirror is a door
 * too.
 *
 * Stubbing the DOORS rather than the job module keeps the test honest: `JOBS`
 * still holds each job's real registration, so the caps-and-windows
 * assertions below are still checking the numbers that ship.
