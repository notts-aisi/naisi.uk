/**
 * The shared TypeScript loader: `tests/lib/tsLoader.mjs`.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * ## What is worth executing here
 *
 * The loader exists because fifty hand-copied versions of it could not read a
 * `.tsx`, and the failure that produced was the worst shape a test failure
 * comes in: the FIRST email template a suite's graph reached killed the whole
 * FILE with a bare `SyntaxError` at import time, before one test ran. It looked
 * like a broken suite rather than a missing compiler option, and the way out
 * everybody found was to stub the template. That is a stub whose only reason to
 * exist is that the tool cannot read the file, which means the template is
 * never executed by anything and a change to it is never noticed.
 *
 * So the class is closed here rather than asserted in prose:
 *
 *  1. a real `.tsx` template compiles and RENDERS through the loader;
 *  2. the same template renders when it is reached the way production reaches
 *     it, through a `.ts` server helper that imports it. That is the exact
 *     failure that bit twice while the worksheet routes were being built;
 *  3. the two resolution rules that make (1) and (2) work are pinned on a
 *     fixture pair of their own: a `.ts` importing a relative `.tsx` with no
 *     extension finds it, and a local import that is NOT TypeScript (a
 *     stylesheet, which every client module's graph reaches within a step or
 *     two) is refused by name instead of being fed to the compiler as if it
 *     were code;
 *  4. a stub still wins over a real module, because every suite's fakes (the
 *     transport, the Admin SDK, the session) depend on that and a loader that
 *     resolved eagerly would put mail on the wire;
 *  5. no file that imports the shared loader also carries a copy of the old
 *     one, AND no file outside the frozen list below carries a copy at all.
 *     Two loaders in one file is the confusion this change removes; a
 *     forty-fourth copy is the class itself coming back, in the one shape a
 *     check that only looks at adopters would never see. A tree walk is what
 *     keeps both out once nobody remembers why.

/**
 * Every suite that imports the shared loader, and why.

 * The seven below are the files this change migrated. Six of them have a `.tsx`
 * in their module graph and had already paid for the missing JSX option, either
 * with template stubs standing in for code nothing executed or with a door
 * stubbed a step earlier than the suite wanted. Those stubs are gone; the doors
 * each suite still fakes (the transport, the Admin SDK handle, the session, the
 * impersonation guard, `firebase-admin` sentinels) stayed, because those are
 * about reaching the outside world rather than about reading a file. The
 * seventh, `worksheet-aggregate`, is the third suite over a tree whose other
 * routes reach the templates, and it moved with its siblings.
 *
 * The list is checked BOTH WAYS: an entry naming a file that no longer imports
 * the loader fails, and a suite importing the loader with no entry fails. A
 * list that can only grow is a list nobody trusts, and the reason column is
 * what makes the next person's decision to adopt it legible.
 *
 * The forty-three suites that still carry their own copy are not required to
 * migrate. That they pass at all is the proof their graphs stop short of a
 * `.tsx`, so a wholesale rewrite would be a large diff with no failure behind
 * it. They move when they next need to change, and until then they are held
 * still by `LEGACY_LOADERS` below.

/**
 * The forty-three suites that still carry a hand-copied loader, frozen.
 *
 * One reason covers the list, because it is one decision: each of these works
 * today, each one's module graph stops short of a `.tsx`, and rewriting them
 * all would be a large diff with no failure behind it. They are here so the
 * check below can tell an OLD copy from a NEW one. That distinction is the
 * whole point: a check that only asks its question of files importing the
 * shared loader would pass a forty-fourth copy pasted into a new suite, which
 * is exactly how this class arrived twice already. The next person to write a
 * suite that reaches an email template would meet the same bare `SyntaxError`
 * and nothing would tell them why.
 *
 * Checked both ways. A file missing from the list fails (import the shared
 * loader instead of pasting a copy), and an entry whose file no longer has a
 * copy fails (migrate it, then delete its line here, so the list can only
 * shrink). Deleting the last entry deletes the check.
