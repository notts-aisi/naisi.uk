/**
 * The applicant apply flow: the release boundary, the payload readers, the
 * availability codec's round trip, and source pins on the parts of the routes
 * that cannot run without a database.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## What is worth executing rather than reading
 *
 *  1. **`serialiseStageForApplicant`** IS the timed-release guarantee.
 *     `admissionRounds/{roundId}/stages/{stageId}` is `allow read, write: if
 *     false`, so the only path from a stored question to a browser runs
 *     through this function. The test asserts the unreleased arm has no
 *     `questions` key AT ALL, rather than an empty one: an applicant with
 *     devtools open must not be able to read week three's essay question in
 *     week one, and "the field is there but empty" is one refactor away from
 *     "the field is there".
 *  2. **The payload readers** decide what an applicant can put on a row nobody
 *     can read back through rules. The geometry pin on `readAvailability` is
 *     the sharpest of them: a client that could name its own grid could store
 *     a mask whose bit 0 means 06:00 while every reader believes it means
 *     09:00, and the failure surfaces as somebody being put in a session they
 *     said they could not make.
 *  3. **The availability round trip** goes through the wire format. Seven hex
 *     strings are what the decide route reads to build seat-row labels, so a
 *     bug in the codec does not look like a broken screen.
 *  4. **The counter arithmetic** is read OUT OF THE ROUTE SOURCE and replayed
 *     against a model, so the test is a second opinion on the increments the
 *     handlers actually contain rather than a copy of them.
 *
 * ## Why the loader dance
 *
 * Same root cause as `admissions-round-console.test.mjs`: this repo's Node
 * predates the v22.18 that strips TypeScript natively, so the module graph is
 * transpiled in memory with the `typescript` devDependency. That also means
 * these tests can only import plain `.ts`, which is why the availability
 * state model lives outside the `.tsx` component that draws it.
