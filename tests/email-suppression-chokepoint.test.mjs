/**
 * The suppression list is consulted at ONE place, and nothing can post mail
 * around it.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## The rule this guards
 *
 * Whether a hard-bounced or complained address is spared must not depend on
 * the CALLER remembering `isSuppressed()` first, so the check lives in
 * `sendEmail()` in `src/lib/email/send.ts`, and nothing else in `src` posts
 * mail. Mailing an address the provider has already told us not to write to is
 * how a sending domain loses its reputation.
 *
 * The rule is "there is one door", so this file guards the door on three
 * levels:
 *
 *  1. by SOURCE, that the check happens before the message is handed over;
 *  2. by WALKING `src`, that no other file builds a transporter of its own, so
 *     the door cannot be walked around;
 *  3. by EXECUTION, that a suppressed recipient is really dropped, really
 *     leaves an `emailSends` row saying so, and that an all-suppressed send
 *     never touches the provider at all.
 *
 * The third is the one that would catch a check that runs and then ignores its
 * own answer, which no source grep can see.
 *
 * Faked for (3): `nodemailer`, `@react-email/render`, `server-only` and
 * `@/lib/firebase/admin`. The Firestore helpers underneath (`filterSuppressed`,
 * `logEmailSend`, `logSuppressedSend`) are the REAL ones, run against a fake
 * db, because the shape of the row they write is half of what is being
 * asserted. Nothing here can reach a Firestore project or an SMTP server.
