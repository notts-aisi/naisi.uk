/**
 * The APPOINTMENT round: the facilitator intake, and the ways it is a
 * different object from the autumn enrolment round rather than the same one
 * with different words on it.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## What is worth pinning here
 *
 *  1. **The readiness matrix, for BOTH kinds.** Readiness is what stands
 *     between an unfinished round and a real applicant, and the two kinds are
 *     held to different lists. A matrix rather than a spot check, because the
 *     failure that costs the facilitator round its window is a check silently
 *     appearing (an outcome target nobody can supply, blocking the Open button
 *     on 21 September) or silently disappearing (a reviewer list nobody
 *     appointed, discovered when the queue is empty on 4 October).
 *  2. **The route refusals.** `admissionRounds` is `allow read, write: if
 *     false`, so the PATCH route is the only writer and its refusals are the
 *     whole of the rule. They are pinned against the source, because the
 *     handler cannot be executed without an Admin SDK.
 *  3. **That the appointment branch of the apply form mounts NO programme
 *     preference.** The gate is the round's KIND, not the section's `enabled`
 *     flag, so a round misauthored past the route's refusal still cannot ask a
 *     volunteer which programme they would like a place on.
 *
 * ## Why the loader dance
 *
 * Same root cause as `admissions-round-console.test.mjs`: this repo's Node
 * predates the v22.18 that strips TypeScript natively, so the module graph is
 * transpiled in memory with the `typescript` devDependency.
