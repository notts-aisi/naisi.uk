/**
 * "End-to-end result": what the required check answers, line by line.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * The branch rules require this check by name, so its answer is what decides
 * whether a pull request may merge. The danger it exists for is a SKIP READ AS
 * A PASS: GitHub counts a job skipped by its own `if:` as successful, and the
 * end-to-end job skips for three unrelated reasons. Each row of the table in
 * `scripts/ci/e2e-result.mjs` is held here, and so is the workflow that feeds
 * it, because a decision that is right and never consulted protects nothing.
