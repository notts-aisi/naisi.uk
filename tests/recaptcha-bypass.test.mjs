/**
 * Guards on the reCAPTCHA harness bypass (src/lib/recaptcha/bypass.ts), run
 * under `npm test` with no credentials.
 *
 * The bypass lets the end-to-end harness through the reCAPTCHA gate on a
 * backend that is given its secret, and it is safe only while four things
 * stay true:
 *
 *   1. Its secret is never provisioned through `apphosting.yaml`, which the
 *      production backend reads.
 *   2. Without the variable the path does not exist: the decision function
 *      returns false before looking at the header or the identity.
 *   3. It is consulted only for a request that carries NO token, so a human
 *      (whose widget always sends one) is verified for real, and only
 *      the harness namespace `e2e-<alnum>@e2e.invalid` can clear it.
 *   4. It sits in the gates, never inside `verifyRecaptcha`, so a present
 *      token is always checked with Google whatever headers came with it.
 *
 * 1, 3 and 4 are source checks; 2 and the identity rule are tested
 * behaviourally by transpiling the module and calling it.
