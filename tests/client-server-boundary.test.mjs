/**
 * The client/server module boundary, walked rather than asserted about.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists for
 *
 * `import "server-only"` is a build-time tripwire: Next refuses a production
 * build when a module carrying it ends up in a client component's graph. The
 * trap is that NOTHING ELSE CATCHES IT. `tsc --noEmit` is happy, eslint is
 * happy, `npm test` is happy, and `next dev` only compiles the routes you
 * happen to open. The whole courses V3 stack went through twenty-seven
 * branches that were typechecked, linted and unit tested green, and the first
 * production build failed with four errors of exactly this shape:
 *
 *   RoundEditor.tsx ("use client")
 *     -> lib/admissions/appointmentQueue.ts   (for appointmentDecideBlock)
 *     -> lib/admissions/statusHub.ts          (for answerText)
 *     -> lib/admissions/applyRoutes.ts        import "server-only"
 *     -> lib/admissions/roundRoutes.ts        import "server-only"
 *
 * One value import of a nine-line helper, four modules down, and the build is
 * dead. The chain is invisible at the call site, which is the point: nobody
 * reads four modules deep to import a predicate.
 *
 * ## What this does
 *
 * It walks the REAL import graph: every file under `src` that begins with
 * `"use client"`, then transitively every relative and `@/` specifier those
 * files reach, and fails naming the whole chain if any reached module imports
 * `server-only`.
 *
 * TYPE-ONLY IMPORTS ARE SKIPPED, because TypeScript erases them and they carry
 * nothing into the bundle. `import type { AppointmentQueueRow } from
 * "@/lib/admissions/appointmentQueue"` is fine and must stay fine: refusing it
 * would push every wire shape into a parallel types module for no benefit.
 * A value import of the same module is not fine, and that is the distinction
 * the walker makes.
 *
 * ## The fix shape, when this test goes red
 *
 * Do NOT delete the `server-only` marker. It is what stops a route module
 * reaching the browser, and other guards lean on it (see
 * `tests/privacy-policy.test.mjs`, which treats reaching
 * `lib/admissions/applyContext.ts` as reaching the access-requirements
 * collection). Move the pure piece the client actually needs into a LEAF
 * module that imports nothing server-only, and have the server module
 * re-export it so no existing call site changes. `lib/admissions/answerText.ts`
 * and `lib/admissions/appointmentRules.ts` are the worked examples.
 *
 * ## The second class: the Admin SDK itself
 *
 * `server-only` is a marker somebody has to remember to write. The Admin SDK
 * is the thing the marker is usually protecting, and reaching it breaks the
 * build whether or not a marker was ever added: `firebase-admin` resolves
 * `fs`, `net` and `http2`, none of which a browser chunk can bundle.
 *
 * That gap is not hypothetical. `src/lib/firestore/memberRecords.ts` is read
 * client-direct by the admin Members page (`useMemberApplications.ts`) and
 * written by the settle and destroy routes, so it sits on both sides at once.
 * It carries no `server-only` marker precisely so the client half can import
 * the normaliser, and it keeps its `firebase-admin/firestore` import TYPE-ONLY
 * for the same reason. Nothing in `npm test` noticed if that first line lost
 * its `type` keyword; the failure arrived as a red production build. A module
 * shaped like that one is the pattern to expect more of, so the walker checks
 * for the SDK by name as well as for the marker.
 *
 * The fix shape is the same one, with an extra option: a type-only import is
 * always fine, so a client-readable module can keep its Admin SDK TYPES and
 * get its sentinels from the Firestore instance it was handed
 * (`memberRecords.ts`'s `serverTimestamp(db)` is the worked example).
