/**
 * Read a TypeScript file as CODE ONLY: comments removed, string and template
 * bodies emptied, everything else left where it was.
 *
 * ## Why a tokeniser rather than four regexes
 *
 * Four regexes in sequence (block comments, then whole-line comments, then
 * templates, then quotes) desync the moment a file carries a TRAILING comment
 * with an apostrophe in it. `// don't` survives the whole-line rule, and the
 * single-quote pass then reads that apostrophe as the start of a string and
 * swallows everything to the next one, which a scanner reports as "nothing to
 * see" rather than as a failure. A guard that silently stops looking is the
 * failure mode these tests exist to remove, so the reading is done once,
 * properly, here.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * One pass, five states: code, line comment, block comment, quoted string,
 * template literal. Comments become a single space, so two tokens either side
 * of one do not fuse. A string keeps its quotes and loses its body, so
 * `"tasks.completerUids"` reads as `""` and cannot be mistaken for a field
 * access, while the expression around it keeps its shape. Template
 * substitutions are dropped with the rest of the body: nothing here needs to
 * read inside one, and keeping them would mean tracking nested braces.
 *
 * Offsets are NOT preserved (comments collapse), so a caller that needs to
 * map a hit back to a line number should split the result rather than index
 * the original.
 *
 * Regex literals are deliberately NOT tracked. Telling `/` division from a
 * regex needs the parser context this file does not have, so the text of a
 * regex is read as code. `assertReadable` below is how a caller asks whether
 * the result is plausible for the input and fails loudly if it is not.

/**
 * `stripSource(src)` empties string and template bodies as well as removing
 * comments. `stripSource(src, { keepStrings: true })` removes only the
 * comments, which is what a caller wants when it is looking for a literal that
 * contains a string or a template (`rateLimit(\`events:rsvp:ip:${ip}\`)`), and
 * still cannot be fooled by a mention of that literal in a comment.
 *
 * BOTH MODES TRACK STRINGS. `keepStrings` changes what is written out, never
 * what is recognised: skipping the string and template states in that mode
 * would read the `//` in `"https://example.com"` as the start of a comment
 * and drop the rest of the line, code included. That is this file's own
 * failure mode (a reader that silently stops looking), and many guards read
 * through that mode.
