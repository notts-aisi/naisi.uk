/**
 * The round console's two pure predicates, plus source pins on the parts of
 * the routes that cannot be executed without a database.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## Why these two predicates get real tests
 *
 *  1. **`planStatusChange`** is the WHOLE status machine.
 *     `admissionRounds` is `allow write: if false`, so the transition table has
 *     no counterpart in `firestore.rules`: the route enforces it, through this
 *     one planner. Every illegal move is enumerated here rather than
 *     spot-checked, because "closed cannot go back to draft" is exactly the
 *     kind of arrow a refactor quietly adds.
 *  2. **`roundReadiness`** is what stands between an unfinished round and a
 *     real applicant. It is rendered by the panel AND enforced by the status
 *     route, so the test that matters is that a check failing is a check the
 *     route will refuse on, not merely a tick that goes grey.
 *
 * ## Why the loader dance
 *
 * Same root cause as `admissions-predicates.test.mjs`: this repo's Node
 * predates the v22.18 that strips TypeScript natively, so the module graph is
 * transpiled in memory with the `typescript` devDependency.
