/**
 * Whether an address belongs to a host is decided by parsing the address.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * `href.includes("accounts.google.com")` is true of
 * `https://elsewhere.example/?next=accounts.google.com` and of
 * `https://accounts.google.com.elsewhere.example/`. So the rule is held for
 * the tree: a host name inside `includes`, `indexOf`, `startsWith`,
 * `endsWith`, `match` or `search` is either parsed instead, or listed here
 * with what the string really is.
