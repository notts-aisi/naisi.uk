/**
 * Every `fetch(` in the harness library goes through `fetchOrExplain`.
 *
 * WHY. The library's fetches set up and tear down (a sign-in exchange, a
 * session cookie, a Mailpit read). A socket-level failure there is reported by
 * undici as `TypeError: fetch failed` with the real code on `cause`, which
 * node:test does not print, and a failure inside a `before` hook cancels every
 * test in the battery. `scripts/e2e/lib/net.mjs` retries once when no response
 * came back and names the cause when it gives up.
 *
 * THE SPLIT IT KEEPS. The batteries under `scripts/e2e/tests/` fetch the
 * target directly and are NOT wrapped: their responses are the assertion, and
 * a repeated POST that the server had in fact processed would be a second
 * write. This guard reads the library only.
