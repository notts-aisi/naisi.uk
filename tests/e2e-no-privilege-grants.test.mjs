/**
 * Offline guards on the e2e harness (run under `npm test` — no network, no
 * credentials, no dev project involved).
 *
 * The harness authenticates against the dev project. Three properties must
 * stay true no matter who edits it next, and a comment saying so is not
 * enforcement:
 *
 *   1. It can never be aimed at production.
 *   2. It never grants a privilege: no role above `pending`, no permissions
 *      map, no `suRecognised`, and none of the admin-set tags. Its accounts are
 *      bare Auth users or (Phase 2 and later) users with a seeded document whose
 *      role is hard-coded to `pending`, the lowest role there is.
 *   3. It reaches only three Firestore collections (`ALLOWED_COLLECTIONS`
 *      below), and one of them delete-only. Phase 1 held "no Firestore at
 *      all"; Phase 2 narrowed that rather than dropping it.
 *
 * Property 1 is tested BEHAVIOURALLY, by calling the real `assertTarget()`
 * rather than pattern-matching the source of the allowlist. Properties 2 and 3
 * are source greps over the harness files.
