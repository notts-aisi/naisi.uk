/**
 * WHO THE SERVER CONTACTS IS THE SERVER'S DECISION, NEVER A LIST THE CALLER
 * WROTE.
 *
 * WHY. A send route addresses only people on the task's roster. A list the
 * caller wrote (`comment.mentions`, the reviewer list on a subtask, the
 * reviewer list on a signoff row) is filtered against that roster by one
 * chokepoint, `src/lib/tasks/recipientScope.ts`, before it is used, and this
 * guard is what keeps every future send inside the same sentence:
 *
 *  1. THE CHOKEPOINT, executed: the roster is `completerUids ∪ reviewerUids`,
 *     and everything else is dropped silently rather than refused, so no
 *     refusal can be read back as a question about which uids exist.
 *  2. THE THREE ROUTES, executed as an approved member on a personal task it
 *     owns and on a shared one: an off-roster uid named in a comment, in a
 *     subtask's reviewer list, or in a signoff row's reviewer list receives
 *     nothing, while the people actually on the task still do. A `pending`
 *     account is refused a step earlier, by the approved-account floor in
 *     `src/lib/firebase/eligibility.ts`, and that is pinned here too so the
 *     two layers are proved together rather than one assumed.
 *  3. THE TREE: every uid array read in a file that can send is registered
 *     with where the array comes from and, when the caller writes it, the
 *     literal that scopes it. Both directions, per-file per-field counts, a
 *     written reason each. A new recipient list fails here until somebody
 *     writes down why the caller cannot choose who it reaches.
 *
 * `tests/task-email-routes.test.mjs` is the neighbour that asks a different
 * question of the same five routes: whether the three gates that decide
 * WHETHER to send still run. This one asks who the send may reach.
