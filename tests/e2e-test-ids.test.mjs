/**
 * The test-id contract, in both directions (run under `npm test`: no browser,
 * no network, no credentials).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A `data-testid` is the one kind of product code an
 * end-to-end suite is allowed to add, and it is also the one kind nobody ever
 * notices going wrong. A spec asks for an id no component carries and the
 * failure is a thirty-second locator timeout that reads like a slow page. A
 * component carries an id no spec asks for and nothing fails at all: the
 * attribute sits in the markup for a year after the spec that wanted it was
 * rewritten, and the next person to see it has no way to tell whether removing
 * it breaks a run.
 *
 * So both directions are checked, by walking:
 *
 *   - every `getByTestId("...")` in `tests/e2e/**` (the specs) and
 *     `scripts/e2e/lib/*.mjs` (the shared helpers);
 *   - every `data-testid="..."` in `src/**\/*.tsx`.
 *
 * An id asked for and not carried fails. An id carried and not asked for
 * fails. Both name the file and the line.
 *
 * LITERALS ONLY, on both sides. `getByTestId(`row-${id}`)` and
 * `data-testid={\`row-${id}\`}` cannot be matched to each other by reading the
 * source, so a template literal on either side would put a hole in the middle
 * of this guard exactly where a suite grows: one dynamic id, then five, then
 * the check covers the handful that were never interesting. A row that needs
 * to be picked out by its data belongs behind a literal id plus a `filter({
 * hasText })`, which is what `approvePendingApplicant` in
 * `scripts/e2e/lib/browser.mjs` does with the approval cards.
 *
 * The one shape that is allowed to be dynamic is a WRAPPER that takes an id as
 * a parameter, and only when it is declared in `DYNAMIC_LOCATORS` with the
 * literal ids it can be called with, and only while each of those ids is ALSO
 * asked for literally somewhere in the same spec file. That last condition is
 * the teeth: the declaration is a note about where a locator is written, never
 * permission for an id this guard cannot see. Reported, not skipped, is the
 * house rule; this is the reporting.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS PART OF THE CONTRACT: `<area>-<thing>`, kebab-case. Not
 * decoration. The ids live in product markup that outlives any one spec, so
 * they have to say which surface they belong to when read cold, months later,
 * by somebody deciding whether a component can be deleted.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. Whether the id is on the RIGHT element. A spec that
 * finds `rsvp-submit` on a heading rather than a button still passes here and
 * fails in the browser, which is the correct place for that failure.
