/**
 * Unit tests for WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A COURSE RUN'S SCHEDULE IS EDITED AFTER
 * DATA EXISTS — the class of bug the P0–P11 suites leave at zero coverage.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `tests/week-plan.test.mjs` pins `currentWeekFor` as a pure function and
 * `tests/course-task-mirror.test.mjs` pins id determinism. Both test the inputs
 * going IN. Nothing tested what happens when an admin moves `startDate`,
 * reorders the week plan, removes a taught week, archives a group, or walks a
 * run's status forward — after members have already read weeks, been mailed,
 * been marked present, and had cards mirrored onto their board.
 *
 * Two systemic causes sit under almost every case in this file:
 *
 *  1. **TWO WEEK-ADDRESSING DOCTRINES.** `WeekPlanBuilder.renumber()` preserves
 *     each entry's `weekId` and reassigns `weekNumber`, and says outright that
 *     the two may legitimately disagree. Every member-facing reader ignores the
 *     plan's `weekId` and addresses `weekDocId(weekNumber)`. So the field the
 *     builder protects is the one almost nobody reads, and a reorder permutes
 *     the curriculum members see away from the one the admin arranged.
 *  2. **SNAPSHOTS TAKEN ONCE, NEVER RE-DERIVED.** `joinedWeekNumber`,
 *     `lastTaskSyncedWeek`, `courseAttendance.sessionAt`, an application's
 *     frozen `availability` string, and the `{startDate}` inside an already-sent
 *     acceptance email are each computed from the schedule at one instant.
 *     Moving the schedule moves reality but not any of them.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of test in here
 *
 * **GUARD** — a property the code really holds. Remove the guard and the test
 * goes red. These are the ones that earn their keep on every future edit.
 *
 * **Behaviour pins** are the tests without that label. They state in their
 * titles what the code does today, and they fail the day that behaviour
 * changes, so when you change one on purpose, change the assertion in the
 * same commit.
 *
 * ## The loader dance
 *
 * Lifted from `course-nudge.test.mjs`, which already solved importing TypeScript
 * from `.mjs` on this repo's Node (v20, no native type stripping) INCLUDING
 * `@/…` alias resolution and stubbing `server-only`. Same rules apply: nothing
 * in `STUBS` is reachable from an assertion here, and no test in this file may
 * ever put mail on the wire.
 *
 * Route handlers cannot be imported at all (`next/server`, `firebase-admin`),
 * so route-level properties are asserted at the SOURCE, exactly as the nudge
 * suite does for the marker ordering. That is not a weaker test — it is the
 * only thing standing between a pure model in here and a route that no longer
 * matches it.

 * STARTS first consumes its own body, so a `//` inside a string is never a
 * comment and a quote inside a comment never opens a string. Template literals
 * are tracked properly because `${…}` is real code inside a string, and a call
 * written there must still count.
 *
 * Regex literals are not lexed (telling `/` division from `/` regex needs the
