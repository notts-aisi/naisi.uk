/**
 * Two guards on the admin console (run via `npm test`, Node's built-in test
 * runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * 1. SELF-LOCKOUT. Nothing under src/app/api/admin/ may ever be gated on the
 *    site-maintenance notice: an admin must always be able to reach the console
 *    and switch the notice OFF while it is on. This asserts no file in that tree
 *    references the gating helpers (`isSurfacePaused`, `assertSurfaceEnabled`
 *    or `siteNoticeServer`), checked by name.
 *    Importing types or validation limits from `@/lib/siteNotice` (as the admin
 *    site-notice route does) is fine; gating is what is forbidden.
 *
 * 2. ROLE GATING. `(app)/admin/layout.tsx` used to be the only role check on
 *    every admin page, and it required `role === "admin"`. It no longer does:
 *    course drafters and approvers are let through the front door so they can
 *    reach `/admin/courses`. Every page that still needs a full admin therefore
 *    has to be gated below that layout, and the shape chosen is a route group:
 *    `src/app/(app)/admin/(admin-only)/**` is wrapped by a layout that calls
 *    `requireAdminPage()`, `src/app/(app)/admin/courses/**` by one that calls
 *    `requireCourseAuthorPage()`, and `src/app/(app)/admin/admissions/**` by
 *    one that calls `requireAdmissionsPage()`. This asserts every admin page
 *    lives in one of those trees and that every gate is still in place, so a course
 *    permission holder cannot reach /admin (approvals), /admin/members,
 *    /admin/deliverability or any other section. A new page dropped straight into
 *    `src/app/(app)/admin/` fails here, which is the point: that location has
 *    no role gate of its own any more.
