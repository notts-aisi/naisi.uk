/**
 * What `main` and `dev` require before a merge is written down, and every
 * check it names exists.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * A branch rule lives on GitHub, not in the repository.
 * `scripts/check-branch-rules.mjs` declares the rules and compares GitHub with
 * them daily. This is the seam on the other side, the declaration against the
 * workflows:
 *
 *  - A REQUIRED CHECK IS A NAME. If the job that reports it is renamed, the
 *    check never arrives and every pull request waits for ever on a check no
 *    run will produce. So every name declared here must be the exact name of a
 *    job in `.github/workflows`.
 *  - The comparison itself is held too: a difference in either direction is a
 *    failure, a setting the token cannot see is said out loud rather than
 *    passed, and `--apply` rewrites the two rules it owns and nothing else.
