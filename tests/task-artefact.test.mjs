/**
 * The task `artefact` pointer, and the worksheet source and kind that go with
 * it.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `artefact` is how a task says WHAT IT IS ABOUT: a discriminated union with
 * one member today (`worksheet-response`) and two the owner has in mind next
 * (an event, a newsletter section). Three properties have to hold at once,
 * and each is a decision rather than an obvious consequence.
 *
 *  1. **An unknown `kind` normalises to null.** Every reader branches on
 *     `kind`, so a build that predates the next member of the union cannot
 *     render one, and "there is no artefact" is the only honest answer it can
 *     give. Carrying the raw map through would put a shape nothing can read
 *     in front of a reader that has already decided it is safe to open.
 *  2. **The field is written, not omitted.** `normalizeTask` fills it in for
 *     every task, but the CREATE write is a raw object literal that TypeScript
 *     never compares against `TaskDoc`, so nothing but a source pin can hold
 *     the two together. Same class of hole as
 *     `tests/admin-permissions-keys.test.mjs`: a whole-object write the type
 *     system does not check.
 *  3. **`worksheet` is a kind, and is not pickable.** It has a label so a
 *     board can show one, and it is deliberately absent from `TASK_KINDS`,
 *     which is what `TaskForm` builds its picker from. A hand-made task
 *     carrying the kind but no pointer would render a worksheet panel with
 *     nothing behind it. For the same reason it is not offered as a SOURCE on
 *     the committee board's filters: that board queries committee-visibility
 *     tasks and every worksheet task is assignees-only, so the option could
 *     only ever empty the board without saying why.
 *
 * The source and the kind prove nothing on their own. What the respond page
 * trusts is the pointer plus the circulation's own response document, which
 * only the worksheet routes write.
 *
 * ## Why the loader dance
 *
 * Same as tests/form-question-limits.test.mjs: this repo's Node predates the
 * v22.18 that strips TypeScript natively, so the module is transpiled in
 * memory with the `typescript` devDependency `npx tsc --noEmit` already uses.
 * `tasks.ts` imports nothing at all, so the graph walk below has no work to
 * do on it today; it is kept in the shape the other suites use so that the
 * day the module grows an import, this file does not have to be rewritten.
