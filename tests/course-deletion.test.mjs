/**
 * Unit tests for the V2-1 DELETION PROTOCOL — the planning half of DESTROY.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * A destroy is the one operation in this codebase that cannot be undone by
 * pressing something else. `accountDeletion.ts` earned its paragraphs the hard
 * way — an ordering rationale, a drained-throw guard, a step SKIPPED OUTRIGHT
 * when its predecessor fails — and none of it was executable. This cascade is
 * bigger (eleven collections, a shared document budget, a resume cursor living
 * on the doomed document itself) and it is driven by an ADMIN reading numbers on
 * a screen. So the parts that can be pinned without a database are pinned here:
 *
 *  - manifest count assembly — the numbers read immediately before the point
 *    of no return, and the fates that say which of them actually die;
 *  - cascade step ORDER — leaf before index, asserted at the SOURCE;
 *  - page-budget arithmetic — the difference between "resume me" and
 *    "I am finished", which is the whole resumability contract;
 *  - the blocker predicates — the sentences standing between an operator and
 *    a live cohort;
 *  - byte-equality of `confirmName` — the last gate, worth nothing if it is
 *    anything less than exact.
 *
 * **The cascade engine is exercised ONLY here and in the rules emulator.**
 * Nothing in this file may reach a Firestore project or put mail on the wire.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of test, labelled
 *
 * **GUARD** — a property the code holds. Break it and the test goes red.
 *
 * **MODEL** — the rule reproduced here and PINNED to the source with an
 * assertion, the `course-schedule-changes.test.mjs` idiom. Neither the engine
 * nor the routes can be imported (`server-only`, `firebase-admin`,
 * `next/server`), so a model plus a pin is the only executable form the rule
 * has. If a pin fails the model has drifted from the code; do not "fix" it by
 * loosening the pin.
 *
 * ## The loader dance
 *
 * Lifted from `course-nudge.test.mjs` / `course-schedule-changes.test.mjs`,
 * which already solved importing TypeScript from `.mjs` on this repo's Node
 * (v20, no native type stripping) including `@/…` aliases and stubbing
 * `server-only`.
