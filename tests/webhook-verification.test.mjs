/**
 * Every webhook route verifies its sender before it trusts a byte of the body,
 * and none confirms a subscription on the sender's say-so.
 *
 * WHY. A webhook is an unauthenticated POST from the internet by definition;
 * the only thing that makes it the provider's is a signature the route
 * checks itself. This guard holds the rule:
 *
 * - every route.ts under src/app/api/webhooks is in VERIFIERS, both ways;
 * - its verifier is called BEFORE the first JSON.parse of the body;
 * - nothing under that tree fetches a URL the body supplied.
