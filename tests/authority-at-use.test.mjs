/**
 * Being named on a document is not a standing grant.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * ## The class
 *
 * A dozen documents carry an array of uids that decides what the people in it
 * may do: a run's `trackLeadUids`, a round's `reviewerUids`, a circulation's
 * `staffUids`, a worksheet's `authorUid`. Each array is written behind a bar —
 * the run roles route intersects with the approved accounts, the round roles
 * route runs `isEligibleAdmissionsReviewer` against each candidate's live user
 * document, a worksheet can only be created by a committee member. The same
 * bar is asked again when the authority is USED, because being named on a
 * document is not a standing grant: `getCurrentUser` refreshes the session
 * from the live user document on every request, and the bar is applied to that
 * session.
 *
 * `firestore.rules` applies the same rule: every helper that grants by naming
 * the caller carries a role test of its own (section 8 below walks them).
 *
 * The server-side half is `src/lib/firebase/eligibility.ts`: one registry of
 * bars, and `isNamedWithStanding(user, authority, named)` which asks both
 * halves of the question at once.
 *
 * ## What this guard does
 *
 * 1. It WALKS THE TREE for the raw comparison — an authority field tested
 *    against the caller's own uid without the helper — and fails on one that
 *    is not registered in `RAW_SITES` as something other than a gate, with a
 *    written reason. Both directions, with a per-file count, so a second site
 *    dropped into a file the registry already names fails instead of folding
 *    into the entry above it. A registered site whose compensating control
 *    lives elsewhere in the same file carries `provedBy`, a literal the file
 *    must still contain, so the entry is an assertion rather than a promise.
 *
 * 2. It checks the registry of bars against the tree in both directions: every
 *    authority is used by at least one file (a bar nobody calls is dead
 *    policy), and every authority NAMED in a call site exists in the registry
 *    (a typo would otherwise throw at run time, on the one branch nobody
 *    exercises).
 *
 * 3. It EXECUTES every bar against every persona and pins the whole matrix,
 *    including the approved-account floor, so widening one is a visible diff
 *    rather than a quiet predicate change.
 *
 * 4. It checks each bar AGREES WITH ITS APPOINTMENT SITE: the two admission
 *    round entries against the real `isEligibleAdmissionsReviewer`, the
 *    circulation entry against the real `canCirculateWorksheet`, the course
 *    entries against the roles routes' own `ELIGIBLE_ROLES` literal, and the
 *    worksheet entry against `isLibraryUser()` in `firestore.rules`. A bar
 *    stricter than its appointment is a support ticket; a bar looser than its
 *    appointment lets a name outlive its standing.
 *
 * 5. It executes the named cases in section 5 below.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * It reads names, not types, so a gate keeps the field name of the authority
 * array it tests (`run.trackLeadUids.includes(actor.uid)`), not a local
 * binding that drops it (`const leads = run.trackLeadUids`). The scanner's
 * patterns are exercised on synthetic snippets below so a regex that had
 * quietly stopped matching fails rather than passes. Whether a route has a
 * gate at all is the gate-before-data guard's subject, not this one. And it
 * does not police ownership scalars that grant nothing beyond the caller's
 * own row (`tasks.creatorUid` on a personal task, `circulations.senderUid`):
 * those are not appointments, so there is no appointment bar to re-ask.

 *                   scoping a query to your own rows, recognising your own
 *                   document.
 *
 * `matches` is the number of raw hits the scanner finds in that file, per
 * field. `provedBy`, where present, is the LIST of control literals the file
 * must still contain, one per branch the reason claims is covered, and each
 * one is written so it includes the control itself (`if (!x) return false;`)
 * rather than the expression the control tests, so deleting the `return`
 * beneath a control fails its entry. An entry without a `provedBy` is
 * asserting that no control is needed. Each control must also appear BEFORE
 * the comparison it compensates for, unless the entry says `controlAfter:
 * true` and explains why: a control that exists but runs after the branch it
 * guards is dead code.
