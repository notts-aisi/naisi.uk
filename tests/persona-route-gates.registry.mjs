/**
 * THE STANDING RED TEAM'S ANSWER KEY: what every route and every authed page
 * answers each persona.
 *
 * One entry per route (by method) and per page under `src/app/(app)`, keyed
 * the way `tests/e2e-coverage-map.test.mjs` keys them (the path under
 * `src/app` with `/route.ts` or `/page.tsx` removed, route groups kept). Each
 * entry says what every persona gets and why, and `tests/persona-route-gates.test.mjs`
 * (offline) checks the tree and this file agree in both directions while
 * `scripts/e2e/tests/persona-route-gates.test.mjs` (a real build, an emulator
 * behind it) drives every cell and asserts the answer.
 *
 * PERSONAS. `anonymous` has no session. `pending`, `rejected`, `member`,
 * `committee` (not SU-recognised), `suCommittee`, `admin`, and one plain
 * member per permissions key (`draftNewsletter`, `approveNewsletter`,
 * `draftEvent`, `approveEvent`, `draftCourse`, `approveCourse`,
 * `manageMembership`, `circulateWorksheet`). Their documents are written by
 * `scripts/e2e/lib/personas.mjs`, to an emulator only.
 *
 * WHAT A CELL MEANS. The battery requests each route with an id that
 * addresses nothing (`e2e-missing-<segment>`) and an empty JSON body, so the
 * status is the GATE's answer, or the first validation's, never a document's.
 * `expect` maps a persona (or `"*"` for everyone not named) to a status. For
 * a page the value is a status, the name of a redirect target from
 * `REDIRECTS`, or a list of names when a gating layout and the page beneath
 * it both redirect and the stream decides which the browser sees first:
 * every target observed must then be one of the list. `fields` lists the top-level keys a 2xx JSON body may carry;
 * a key outside it fails. `drive` overrides the request (a body, a query
 * string) with the reason, for a route whose gate sits behind a validation
 * an empty body never reaches.
 *
 * The helpers below are the recurring shapes, so an entry reads as a
 * decision rather than a table. Every entry carries `why`.
