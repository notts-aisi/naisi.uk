/**
 * Document ids: `{slug}__{8 base36 characters}`, and the eight are not
 * guessable.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * `slugId` names most documents the app creates. Its suffix is drawn from the
 * platform's cryptographic generator, never from `Math.random`. Nothing treats
 * an id as a secret, but ids minted on the server are shown to clients, and an
 * id that cannot be predicted costs one call to that generator. This holds the
 * SHAPE (other code and the Firestore console both depend on it) and the
 * SOURCE of the randomness.
