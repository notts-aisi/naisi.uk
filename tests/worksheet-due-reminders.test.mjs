/**
 * The worksheet due-soon reminders job.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## What is worth executing here
 *
 *  1. **It ships dark.** The job emails and pushes to people, and
 *     `config/scheduler` reads a missing row as the job's own default, so
 *     `enabledByDefault: false` is the difference between a job an admin arms
 *     and a job that arms itself on whatever data an environment holds the
 *     moment it deploys.
 *  2. **The order of operations.** Claim, then send, then stamp. The fake
 *     below inspects the marker FROM INSIDE the send, which is the only way to
 *     prove the claim really precedes the send rather than merely appearing
 *     earlier in the file.
 *  3. **The audience.** A submitted or reviewed response is out of it by
 *     construction. Reminding somebody to finish work they have already sent
 *     back is the one message this job could send that would make a person
 *     trust it less.
 *  4. **Both channels, independently.** The owner asked for an email switch
 *     and a push switch per event, so email-off-push-on is a real setting and
 *     is executed here rather than reasoned about.
 *  5. **The schedule and the ceiling.** The sender's own slot list is the
 *     schedule now, so the tests that matter are the ones at its edges: two
 *     slots on different days are two reminders, two resolving to one moment
 *     are one, a slot on the due day fires ON the due day, a slot further
 *     past its moment than `maxLateHours` is dropped, and a deadline already
 *     gone is out of the scan. The deadline hours away, which an earlier
 *     lateness rule silenced, is still executed here because that bug is the
 *     reason the lateness bound is now measured from the slot.
 *
 * ## The fake Firestore
 *
 * A double, not the emulator: `npm test` has no emulator and must not reach a
 * project. It implements what the handler uses (doc get, doc create, doc set
 * with merge, a subcollection, a query with equality / range / `in` filters
 * plus a limit and a cursor, a transaction, and a resolving server timestamp)
 * and nothing else. The email send, the push mirror, the suppression list and
 * the Admin SDK are stubbed at the module boundary, so no test in this file
 * can put mail on the wire or a notification on a phone.

 * production: a handler that took its database as a parameter would be a
 * handler this suite tested in a shape the tick never runs.
 *
 * The two admissions entries are here because this file loads `registry.ts`
 * for `policyFor`, and the registry imports every registered job by value, so
 * the admissions job's send path is in this suite's graph whether or not
 * anything here runs it. A door, not a compiler workaround: the shared loader
 * compiles the `.tsx` components behind it perfectly well, and these two are
 * stubbed because a suite that can reach a transport is a suite that can put
