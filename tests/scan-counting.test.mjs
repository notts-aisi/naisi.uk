/**
 * Scan counting for printed QR codes.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * A QR code on a poster encodes `naisi.uk/q/<slug>`. The short-link route
 * answers the scan and lands it on a page carrying `?q=<slug>` (what it sends
 * is `tests/tracked-links.test.mjs`'s subject); `ScanBeacon`, mounted in the
 * root layout, then posts to
 * `/api/q/<slug>/scan`, which increments a per-code per-day counter. Four
 * promises hold that arrangement together, and each one is held here by
 * running the code that ships rather than by describing it:
 *
 *  1. PAPER IS PERMANENT. A slug that has been printed is never removed,
 *     renamed or reused. The list below is the record of what is on paper; a
 *     new code is added to it, and nothing already in it may change.
 *  2. NOTHING ABOUT A PERSON IS KEPT. The counter's write is executed against
 *     a fake database and its fields compared with a closed list. The privacy
 *     policy says request logs are not used for analytics and lists every
 *     cookie and storage key the site sets, so neither the route nor the
 *     beacon may read a header that identifies a device or touch browser
 *     storage. That is what lets this ship with the policy unchanged.
 *  3. ONLY A LINK THAT EXISTS IS COUNTED, AND ONLY BY A POST. The route is driven
 *     through every branch. A GET that counted would count link previews and
 *     mail scanners; `tests/get-handlers-readonly.test.mjs` refuses any GET
 *     that calls `recordScan`, and this file checks that entry is still there.
 *  4. COUNTING NEVER BREAKS THE PAGE. The beacon is the one piece of this that
 *     runs on a page somebody has just opened at a stall.
