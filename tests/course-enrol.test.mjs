/**
 * Unit tests for OPEN ENROLMENT: the enrolment window, the public group
 * picker's field projection, and the seat that two people click at once.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * ## The three properties, and why each earns a test
 *
 *  1. **The window.** A pre-course keeps taking sign-ups in
 *     `applications-closed` and in `running`, which is exactly where
 *     `applicationWindow()` says no. That widening is the whole behavioural
 *     difference between the two predicates, and it is the kind of difference
 *     a later tidy-up would collapse "because they read the same two fields".
 *     The full status matrix is asserted so a new `CourseRunStatus` cannot
 *     silently join the admitting set.
 *
 *  2. **The projection.** `courseGroups` is read-restricted in
 *     `firestore.rules` precisely so that a joinable meeting link is not
 *     enumerable by anybody who can guess a doc id. `fetchGroupPicker` reads
 *     it on the Admin SDK, where rules provide no defence at all, and hands
 *     the result to an anonymous visitor. So the key set is pinned EXACTLY,
 *     not merely checked for the fields we currently remember to worry about:
 *     the leak this prevents is the field somebody adds to `CourseGroupDoc`
 *     next year.
 *
 *  3. **The last seat.** Capacity is enforced against the counter read INSIDE
 *     the enrol transaction. The route's gate is `groupFullError`, exported
 *     for this reason: modelling the transaction against the real predicate
 *     tests the code, while modelling it against a re-implementation would
 *     only test the model.
 *
 * ## Why the loader dance
 *
 * Same root cause as `course-window.test.mjs`: this repo's Node predates the
 * v22.18 that strips TypeScript natively, so the module graph is transpiled in
 * memory with the `typescript` devDependency `npx tsc --noEmit` already uses.
