/**
 * Guard for the V3 W3 PR20 draft-read narrowing (run via `npm test`, Node's
 * built-in runner, no dependencies).
 *
 * The rule: a `courses` document with `status: 'draft'` and a `courseRuns`
 * document with `status: 'draft'` are readable only by admins, `draftCourse`
 * and `approveCourse` holders, the author, and (on the course only) the
 * course's `collaboratorUids`. The emulator suite
 * (`scripts/rules-tests/tests/courses.test.mjs`) proves the rule. This test
 * guards the OTHER half, which rules cannot see: WHO ISSUES THE READ.
 *
 * Two things make that worth a standing test rather than a review note.
 *
 *  1. Firestore judges a list on the query's potential result set, not on the
 *     rows it returns, so an UNFILTERED client list over either collection is
 *     now refused wholesale for a caller holding no course permission, even
 *     when every stored document happens to be published. A member-facing
 *     surface that adds such a list does not degrade: it breaks, and it breaks
 *     only once somebody saves a draft.
 *  2. The narrowing is invisible from the calling code. Nothing in
 *     `getDocs(collection(db, "courses"))` says who may run it.
 *
 * So the list below is the guard: every file allowed to touch the `courses` or
 * `courseRuns` document or collection through the CLIENT SDK is named here with
 * the surface it belongs to, and a new one fails this test until somebody
 * writes down which gate it sits behind.
 *
 * OUT OF SCOPE, deliberately. A path whose segments continue into `"weeks"`
 * (the `courseRuns/{runId}/weeks` subcollection) is ignored here: `useWeek`,
 * `useGroupWeeks` and `ProgressBody` read it client-direct. Admin SDK code is
 * out of scope too, because it bypasses rules entirely; this test only looks
 * at files importing from `firebase/firestore`.
