/**
 * The queued new-event announcement job.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials, no
 * network).
 *
 * ## What is worth executing here, and why a source grep would not do
 *
 *  1. **It ships dark, and so does the path that feeds it.** The job emails
 *     and pushes to a whole list, and `config/scheduler` reads a missing row
 *     as the job's own default. What is new is that the same switch also
 *     decides what PUBLISHING does, so `announcementQueueEnabled` is executed
 *     against a real `config/scheduler` document rather than asserted about.
 *  2. **Exactly once, across ticks.** The whole design rests on one marker per
 *     recipient per leg: a tick that runs out of budget half way down the list
 *     leaves what it sent stamped, and the next tick's claim on those fails
 *     with ALREADY_EXISTS. That is not visible in a source read, so this suite
 *     runs two ticks and counts the messages.
 *  3. **The totals survive a tick boundary.** They are persisted onto the
 *     event at the end of every tick precisely so an announcement that took
 *     four ticks can still say what all four did, and a test that only ever
 *     ran one tick would never notice them being dropped.
 *  4. **The two release rules, which point in opposite directions.** A pure
 *     refusal hands `announcedAt` back so a republish can requeue; a STALE
 *     refusal keeps it, because there is no later moment at which announcing
 *     a past event becomes right. Both are executed.
 *  5. **The audience is the real one.** The junction read, the members-only
 *     guest drop, the per-address hydration and the events push cell all run
 *     for real against the fake database, because the point of factoring them
 *     out of `eventAnnouncement.ts` was that both paths ask one question.
 *
 * ## The fakes
 *
 * A fake Firestore, not the emulator, implementing what this graph uses: doc
 * get / set / update / create, an `in` query with a limit, a transaction with
 * get and update, a resolving server timestamp, a real `FieldValue.delete()`,
 * `FieldValue.increment` and DOTTED FIELD PATHS. The last two are not
 * decoration: the job writes its counts as increments on paths into
 * `announcementResult` so overlapping ticks cannot write each other's work
 * away, and a fake that stored `"announcementResult.sent"` as a literal key
 * would pass every one of those assertions while the shipping code clobbered
 * the map.
 * The transport, the push service, the subscription junction, the suppression
 * list and the token signer are stubbed at the module boundary, so nothing
 * here can put mail on the wire or a notification on a phone. Everything
 * between those doors is shipping code.
