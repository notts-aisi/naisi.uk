/**
 * A scheduled check that does not pass reaches a person.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * `scripts/ci/alert-issue.mjs` keeps one issue per check: opened when it stops
 * passing, commented on while it stays that way, closed when it passes again.
 * This drives it against a GitHub that lives in memory
 * and holds the four rows of its table, plus the two ways an alert could
 * quietly not be one: a SKIPPED check read as fine, and an issue nobody is
 * told about.
