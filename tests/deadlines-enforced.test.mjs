/**
 * A DEADLINE SOMEBODY IS TOLD ABOUT IS ENFORCED BY THE WRITE IT BOUNDS.
 *
 * WHY. A deadline that is stored and shown to a person, and that no write
 * refuses past, is a promise the product does not keep. An admission stage's
 * own `closesAt` is the case in point: a stage submit is bounded by the
 * stage's own deadline as well as by the ROUND's window, and the ordinary form
 * asks the same question the routes do. That is the same fairness property the
 * release boundary exists to protect, at the other end of the stage.
 *
 * The shape to avoid is a function that computes a deadline and is only ever
 * read by something that TELLS a person about it. So the guard asks two
 * questions of the tree, and executes the boundary:
 *
 *  1. EVERY STORED DEADLINE is registered. The scan reads the property
 *     declarations under `src/lib` and `src/app/api` for a field whose name
 *     says it is a time limit. Each one says who it binds, where they are
 *     told, and either where it is enforced or, in writing, why nothing
 *     refuses past it. Both directions, per-field counts. A new deadline field
 *     fails here until the question is answered.
 *  2. EVERY FUNCTION THAT COMPUTES ONE has each of its call sites classified as
 *     telling somebody, enforcing a write, or deriving another predicate. Both
 *     directions against the tree, and the sentence that closes the class: a
 *     function with a `tells` site and no `enforces` site FAILS.
 *  3. THE DEADLINE, EXECUTED: `isStageOpenForAnswers` over the boundary, the
 *     stage submit route one millisecond either side of the deadline, the draft
 *     save refusing a change to a closed stage, and the applicant's own view of
 *     the stage carrying the same instant the routes refuse past.
