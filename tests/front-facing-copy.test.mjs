/**
 * Three decisions about what the site says, held in place.
 *
 * Run with `npm test` (Node's built-in runner, no emulator, no credentials).
 *
 * 1. THE SITE DOES NOT PROMISE HOW OFTEN IT EMAILS. Both sign-up forms and the
 *    profile's notification grid described the newsletter and the event
 *    announcements as low frequency. Event announcements go out whenever an
 *    event is published, which in freshers' week is often, so the promise was
 *    one the society did not keep and had no way to. The phrase had been
 *    pasted into five places, which is how it would come back. Copy says what
 *    an email IS; it does not say how many there will be.
 *
 * 2. /resources IS HIDDEN FOR NOW. The page is being rewritten and the owner
 *    would rather nothing showed than what is there. A temporary redirect in
 *    next.config.ts takes over from the page without touching it, and nothing
 *    on the site links to it. TO BRING IT BACK: delete the /resources entry in
 *    next.config.ts, add an entry to src/layout/publicNav.ts, restore the link
 *    commented out in src/content/links.ts, and delete the second part of
 *    this file.
 *
 * 3. COPY A MEMBER READS NEVER NAMES THE OPERATOR'S TOOLS. A page that tells
 *    a person to "Enable Email/Password in the Firebase console" is giving an
 *    instruction for the one person who runs the project to everyone who does
 *    not. A fault on our side is reported to a member as a fault on our side
 *    and nothing else. Admin screens are the exception, and the whole of it:
 *    an admin IS the operator, and "edit the document in the Firebase
 *    console" is the right thing to tell one.
