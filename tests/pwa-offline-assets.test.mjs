/**
 * Guards for the service worker's write-nothing contract and the offline
 * page's self-containment (run via `npm test`, Node's built-in runner).
 *
 * public/sw.js promises, in its docblock, that the only Cache Storage write
 * it ever performs is one cache.add("/offline.html") and that it never
 * caches HTML routes. That promise is what makes skipWaiting safe, makes
 * deploys unbrickable (App Hosting does not keep old /_next/static
 * addressable, so any cached document would 404 its chunks after a
 * rollout), and keeps authed HTML out of shared-device storage. Prose
 * contracts drift; these assertions do not.
 *
 * The emergency worker (scripts/pwa/sw-kill.js) contains zero cache.add
 * calls by design, and deploying it means copying it over public/sw.js. It is
 * therefore exempt from the write-nothing assertions, so the rollback that
 * must merge fastest cannot be blocked by its own test suite.
