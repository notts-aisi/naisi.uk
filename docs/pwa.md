# The installable app (PWA)

The site is installable to the home screen on iOS and Android while remaining an ordinary website. "Installed" means exactly Add to Home Screen from Safari's share sheet on iOS, or Chrome's install affordance on Android. There is no app store, no wrapper, no second codebase, and no build step beyond the normal one.

Everything here is progressive enhancement: a browser that ignores every PWA file sees the site unchanged, byte for byte, except the `theme-color` meta tag that tints Chrome on Android's address bar.

## The pieces

| Piece | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manifest | `src/app/manifest.ts` | Makes the site installable. Served at `/manifest.webmanifest`. This alone is the whole installability feature; nothing else is required by either platform |
| Icons | `src/app/favicon.ico`, `src/app/icon.svg`, `src/app/apple-icon.png`, `public/icons/` | Made by `npm run brand` from `brand-source/`, never placed by hand; `tests/brand-assets.test.mjs` holds them to the masters. The browser tab (`favicon.ico`, `icon.svg`: a tower cut for 16 pixels) and the home screen (`apple-icon.png`, `icons/icon-192.png`, `icons/icon-512.png`: the whole emblem on its own ground) are different pictures on purpose. Each manifest icon is listed as both plain and maskable, and the test fails if new artwork lets the emblem leave the circle Android crops to |
| Standalone detection | `src/lib/pwa/displayMode.ts`, `src/hooks/useDisplayMode.ts`, `src/features/pwa/StandaloneFlag.tsx` | Predicates, the React hook, and a pre-paint inline script that stamps `data-standalone` / `data-standalone-ios` on `<html>`. Use the ATTRIBUTES for anything affecting layout (no hydration flash); use the HOOK for behaviour |
| Service worker | `public/sw.js`, registrar in `src/features/pwa/` | Offline fallback page and the `beforeinstallprompt` prerequisite. See below |
| Session repair | `src/auth/SessionSanityGuard.tsx` | Fixes the cookie-without-client-user state installed apps can land in |
| Back-gesture dismissal | `src/hooks/useHistoryDismiss.ts` | The system back gesture closes overlays instead of navigating away |
| Safe areas | see `docs/mobile-conventions.md` | The idiom, the border-box trap, and the full inventory |
| Install affordances | `src/features/pwa/InstallCard.tsx`, `InstallLink.tsx`, `installPrompt.ts` | A dismissible dashboard card (one localStorage key, no timers) and a permanent drawer row. Both vanish when installed |
| Relaunch restore | `src/features/pwa/lastRoute.ts`, `LastRouteTracker.tsx`, `RelaunchRestore.tsx` | iOS relaunches killed apps at start_url; this returns signed-in members to their last authed route. Android is handled by the manifest's `launch_handler` instead. The tracker's placement in the (app) layout is what scopes recording to signed-in members |
| Google sign-in | `GoogleSignInButton.tsx`, `/api/auth/google/callback` | Popup in every browser tab, redirect ONLY when installed (the one context that cannot popup). The gate was briefly "all mobile" and real devices argued it back down; the reasoning is in the button |
| Back gesture | `src/hooks/useHistoryDismiss.ts` | Closes overlays instead of navigating. Dismissals must go THROUGH the returned dismiss(); the hook never unwinds on close, because a close during navigation cannot be told apart and an unwind there cancels the navigation. That bug shipped for a few hours; the docblock has the full story |

## The service worker contract

`public/sw.js` is deliberately write-nothing. The only Cache Storage write in the file is one `cache.add("/offline.html")`, and the fetch handler answers exactly one class of request: same-origin GET navigations, network-first, falling back to the offline page only on a genuine network failure. Everything else, including `/_next/static/**`, `/api/**`, RSC fetches and downloads, falls through untouched.

Why: Firebase App Hosting rebuilds a container per rollout and does not keep the previous build's content-hashed assets addressable, so any cached HTML document would reference chunks that 404 after the next deploy. That is an unrecoverable white screen. The austerity is the safety property, and `tests/pwa-offline-assets.test.mjs` enforces it, so a future edit that broadens the worker fails `npm test` rather than shipping quietly.

`public/offline.html` is generated from `scripts/offline-template.html` by `npm run brand`, with the emblem inlined as a data URI. Edit the template, never the output. It must stay fully self-contained; the test enforces that too.

The push and notificationclick handlers are live. The server sends the Declarative Web Push envelope (`web_push: 8030`, built in `src/lib/push/send.ts`), which Safari 18.4+ renders without waking the worker at all; Chromium and Firefox land in the handler, which reads the same envelope. The `event.waitUntil(showNotification)` wrapping is mandatory and test-enforced: iOS treats a push with no visible notification as a broken promise and revokes the subscription after roughly three.

## Web push

Per-device opt-in on `/profile` (`src/features/pwa/PushSettings.tsx`), a server pipeline in `src/lib/push/`, and a server-only `pushSubscriptions` collection keyed by endpoint hash, holding the member's uid as "who most recently claimed this device". Members can send themselves a test from the same card. The account-level answers are NOT on that card: they are the Push column of the notification grid on the profile form above it (`src/features/profile/ProfileForm.tsx`), one cell per category beside the email cell of the same row, because the per-device card renders nothing without a VAPID key or on a browser without push and an account preference must not be unreachable for want of the right hardware. The column is disabled with a hint when this browser has no subscription, and still shows the stored value. Both surfaces read one state machine (`src/features/pwa/pushDevice.tsx`), so the card and the column cannot disagree about what this device can receive. On iOS, notifications only exist inside the installed app, and the card says so rather than showing a dead button.

Rules that keep it working, all encoded in the code and worth not re-learning:

- Permission is requested only inside a tap handler; Safari silently ignores anything else.
- Every profile visit re-syncs the existing subscription to the server. Safari iOS never fires `pushsubscriptionchange`, so server-side 404/410 pruning plus client re-assertion is the entire liveness story.
- Never `unsubscribe()` on sign-out: Safari will not re-permit a subscribe without a fresh gesture, and the subscription belongs to the device, not the session.
- A 404/410 from the push service is NOT believed for the first two minutes of a row's life. Measured against FCM (2026-08-29): a subscription Chrome had just created answered 410 "unsubscribed or expired" for roughly its first nine seconds, then 201 forever after. Pruning on that first 410 deleted the row the member had just registered, so "Enable" then "Send a test" always reported nothing sent. `send.ts` keys a grace window to `createdAt`, and the self-test route retries inside it; task mirrors just drop that one push. `tests/push-prune-grace.test.mjs` guards the window.

**The feature is dormant until VAPID keys are provisioned.** The routes return 503 and the profile card renders nothing. Local dev reads the keypair from `.env.local`.

### Provisioning a backend

Generate a keypair with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`, one per environment. Then, per project:

```
firebase apphosting:secrets:set NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY --project <PROJECT_ID>
firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY --backend <BACKEND_ID> --project <PROJECT_ID>
firebase apphosting:secrets:set VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY --project <PROJECT_ID>
firebase apphosting:secrets:grantaccess VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY --backend <BACKEND_ID> --project <PROJECT_ID>
```

Then add to `apphosting.yaml`, ONLY after the secrets exist in every project that deploys from it, because a referenced secret that does not exist fails the next rollout:

```yaml
  - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
    secret: NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
    availability: [BUILD, RUNTIME]
  - variable: VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY
    secret: VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY
    availability: [RUNTIME]
```

The public key rides Secret Manager not for secrecy (it ships in the client bundle by design) but because secret references resolve by name per project, which is what gives each environment its own keypair without console-UI steps.

What sends pushes: the self-test, the TASK pipeline, the COURSE DECISION moments, the new-event announcement, and the notice lane. Every task email (added-to-task, comment, mention, review request, review outcome) is mirrored to the recipient's enabled devices by `src/lib/push/taskNotifications.ts`. An admissions decide (both the appointment and the decline branch) and an allocation publish are mirrored by `src/lib/push/courseNotifications.ts`. Publishing an event notifies every account with a device whose `events` push cell is on, and sending a newsletter does the same for the `newsletter` cell; both go through one shared enumeration, `sendPushToRowAudience` in `src/lib/push/rowAudience.ts`, dispatched concurrently with their own email leg. A members-only event drops the guest rows from the EMAIL half and pushes to the same accounts. A notice from an organiser or a facilitator goes through `src/lib/push/noticeNotifications.ts`, which reads no preference at all and is the one push here that does not: [docs/notifications.md](notifications.md) has the class and the caps that bound it. For the mirrors, two consequences of riding beside an email still hold: the config/task-emails kill switch covers task push for free because every route early-returns before its sends, and volume is bounded by the existing email budget. What does NOT hold, and is what this paragraph used to say, is that a mirror follows the email EXACTLY. Since the grid landed the push cell is read independently of the email cell, so a member with the email cell off and the push cell on is notified with no email beside it, which is precisely what the cell copy promises them: [the two server reads](notifications.md#the-two-server-reads).

Enabling notifications on a device is still the opt-in that makes any of this happen. On top of it sits the PUSH COLUMN of the notification grid: `profile.notifications.push`, one boolean per row (`newsletter`, `events`, `courses`, `tasks`), read server-side by `src/lib/push/preferences.ts`. It is a SIBLING of `channels` and `categories` in `src/lib/firestore/notifications.ts`, never a member of either, because `channels` means email-address routing and a transport with no address folded into it would break `addressesForSend`. Defaults come from one per-row table shared with the email column: `courses` and `tasks` are opt-out (absent is "hasn't answered", and defaulting false would have switched off, for everyone at once, notifications people had already enabled) while `newsletter` and `events` are opt-in. `courseDecisions` is the old name of the `courses` cell and is still READ as an alias, never written. All four cells have a producer: `tasks` and `courses` through the mirrors that ride beside their emails, `events` and `newsletter` through the shared device enumeration the two opt-in rows share. Only the opt-in rows may be produced that way, because an absent cell on `courses` or `tasks` resolves ON and enumerating every device would notify accounts that never asked. A failed preference read fails closed.

A decision push names the round, the course or the group and never the reason: a lock screen is a surface the member did not choose. The weekly course nudge and the admissions deadline reminders deliberately do NOT push, and `tests/push-preferences.test.mjs` asserts neither file imports anything from `lib/push`: a scheduled email that also buzzes every phone in a cohort is how people turn notifications off for good. The admissions stage release is the one scheduled job that does push, settled by the owner on 6 September 2026: a new part of an application form opening is the moment there is something new to answer, not a countdown. It goes through the same `mirrorCourseDecisionToPush` door as a decision, inside the same per-recipient marker as its email, so nobody is pushed about a stage twice and a push failure can never re-mail a round; the same test file pins that shape. The events row pushes at exactly one moment, when an event is published; there is no event reminder job. The newsletter row pushes at exactly one moment too, when an approved draft is sent, and the notification carries the subject and lands on `/dashboard` because a newsletter has no web view to open. A subscription belongs to a browser profile and survives sign-out, so the audience of either row is devices whose last claimant holds the cell rather than signed-in sessions: a signed-out device that taps one lands on the sign-in page, which is still this app and still the right door.

### Rolling it back

Two levers, tested in this order on dev before anything promotes to main:

1. **Primary**: flip `SERVICE_WORKER_ENABLED` to `false` in `src/features/pwa/config.ts` and merge. Every visitor's next page load unregisters all workers on the origin and deletes every `naisi-` cache. This works because the constant ships in the app bundle, which the worker never caches.
2. **Secondary**, if the registrar itself is suspect: `cp scripts/pwa/sw-kill.js public/sw.js` and merge. Browsers pick it up on their next update check (the `Cache-Control: no-cache` header on `/sw.js` in `next.config.ts` plus `updateViaCache: "none"` make that prompt), and it deletes every cache, unregisters itself, and reloads open windows. The kill switch is exempt from the write-nothing check, so deploying it cannot fail `npm test`.

Do not build rollback reasoning on assumptions about what a 404'd `sw.js` does to an existing registration; browsers differ. The kill worker is the reliable path.

### Local development

`next dev` never registers the worker. To exercise it locally, either set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SW_ENABLE=true` in `.env.local` (never in an App Hosting console; console vars are always build-inlined) or use a production build with `next start`. A LAN IP over plain HTTP will not register a worker at all; only `localhost` and HTTPS are secure contexts.

## Auth inside the installed app

iOS gives an installed app its own storage partition. The `__session` cookie and Firebase Auth's IndexedDB do not necessarily both come across from Safari, which produces two states the site now handles:

- Cookie without client user: `SessionSanityGuard` clears the cookie through `POST /api/auth/session/clear` (never the token-revoking DELETE) and returns to login.
- Client user without cookie: the pre-existing self-heal in `AuthEntry` re-mints.

Google sign-in: `window.open()` returns null inside an installed iOS app, so GIS popup mode cannot work there. The button detects the refusal (a `window.open` wrapper scoped to accounts.google.com) and the auth card reorders on iOS standalone so email and password lead. Redirect mode for mobile and standalone is the durable fix and is tracked as its own PR; note that accounts created through the Google button have no password until they set one via the reset email.

Every link in every email this site sends opens in the default browser, not the installed app. That is an iOS platform property; changing it would require Universal Links and a native App ID. Do not file it as a bug.

## Deliberately not done, and why

- **Firestore `persistentLocalCache`**: would change what a cache-served snapshot means for `useSiteNotice` (which refuses to light `/status` green on one) and `useEventRsvps` (which forces server reads after Admin-SDK writes), and lets the app confidently show stale data with no tell.
- **`apple-touch-startup-image` splash screens**: one exactly-sized PNG per device geometry, 25+ files, for a sub-second screen. Android gets a real splash from `background_color` for free; iOS shows its white flash.
- **`black-translucent` status bar**: needs a legacy meta Next cannot emit plus a full-bleed audit of every top edge. `default` gives an opaque bar with the page below it.
- **`overscroll-behavior-y: none`**: would remove Android's pull-to-refresh, the only reload gesture an installed window has. The top strip carries an explicit reload button when standalone instead.
- **A "new version available" prompt**: pointless when no HTML is cached; updates are invisible by construction, and a `controllerchange` reload listener would race `hardNavigate()`.

## Device checklist

Run on a real iPhone and a real Android handset against dev.naisi.uk before any dev to main promotion. Install, then: icon and splash correct; launches full-screen with an opaque status bar; sign in (email+password, and Google once redirect mode lands); an event RSVP page reads correctly with no browser chrome; Add to calendar produces the calendar sheet; one admin CSV export saves; a reading-list link, a task attachment and the Google Calendar link all return cleanly to the app; the keyboard does not occlude the focused field on /login, /register and a task comment box; a view-as session can be exited and re-entered; background the app for 1/5/30 minutes and overnight and note where it relaunches; airplane mode then navigate shows the offline page and recovery on reconnect is instant; the back gesture closes an open drawer, modal and bottom sheet on Android.
