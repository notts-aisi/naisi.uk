# Mobile baseline — events RSVP

The public events RSVP/registration flow is the site's most mobile-mature surface. It is the hard "do not regress" surface for the mobile-friendliness initiative. This document is the contract.

## Mobile-frozen modules

These CSS modules back the public events flow. Any PR that touches them, or touches anything shared that they consume, must re-verify the baseline below before merging.

- [src/features/events/EventDetailView.module.css](../src/features/events/EventDetailView.module.css)
- [src/features/events/RsvpForm.module.css](../src/features/events/RsvpForm.module.css)
- [src/features/events/BlockView.module.css](../src/features/events/BlockView.module.css)
- [src/features/events/FormRenderer.module.css](../src/features/events/FormRenderer.module.css)
- [src/features/events/CoverImage.module.css](../src/features/events/CoverImage.module.css)

The components consuming these modules live in `src/features/events/` and are rendered by the public route `src/app/(public)/events/[id]/` and its sub-routes (`rsvp/[rsvpId]/change`, `rsvp/[rsvpId]/cancel`, `rsvp/submitted`).

### What counts as "shared" here

Naming the shared surfaces explicitly, because the original wording said only "a shared token" and that read narrower than it is. All five events routes wrap their content in `className="container"`, so a change to that one rule in `globals.css` reaches every page in this flow and is the single highest-blast-radius edit available.

- [src/theme/tokens.css](../src/theme/tokens.css), [src/theme/typography.css](../src/theme/typography.css), [src/theme/breakpoints.ts](../src/theme/breakpoints.ts)
- [src/app/globals.css](../src/app/globals.css) — in particular `.container` and the `body` rules
- [src/app/(public)/layout.tsx](../src/app/(public)/layout.tsx), [src/layout/PublicHeader.module.css](../src/layout/PublicHeader.module.css), [src/layout/PublicFooter.module.css](../src/layout/PublicFooter.module.css) — the chrome every one of these pages renders inside
- The root `viewport` export in [src/app/layout.tsx](../src/app/layout.tsx)

## Viewports to verify at

- **375 × 667** — iPhone SE / iPhone 12 mini portrait. The narrow-phone reference.
- **414 × 896** — iPhone Plus / Pro Max portrait. Most-common large phone.
- **768 × 1024** — iPad portrait. The exact `--bp-md` boundary; verify the layout transition is clean.
- **1024 × 1366** — iPad landscape / small laptop. Above `--bp-lg`; should match desktop.
- **844 × 390** — iPhone 14/15 **landscape**, on a notched device. Added because the four viewports above are all portrait phone or iPad, and a notch only intrudes on the left and right edges in landscape. `viewport-fit: cover` is on at the root, so safe-area regressions are invisible at every other viewport in this list. Verify on real hardware or a simulator: DevTools does not model the inset.

## Flows to re-run

For each viewport above, walk through:

1. **Anonymous RSVP submit.** Open `/events/[id]` on a draft event. Fill the RSVP form (name, email, custom questions). Submit. Confirmation page renders.
2. **Signed-in RSVP submit.** Same as above but signed in as a member. Form prefills name/email. Submit. Confirmation page renders.
3. **RSVP change request.** From a confirmation page, click "Change my answers." Modify a field. Submit. Confirmation that change is pending.
4. **RSVP self-cancel.** From a confirmation page, click "Cancel my RSVP." Confirm. Cancellation page renders.

## What "still works" means

- **No horizontal page scroll** at any viewport. Internal-scrolling containers (none in this flow currently) are the exception.
- **No clipped controls.** Every form field, button, and link is fully visible and tappable.
- **Sticky RSVP panel does not cover content** at viewports where it remains sticky. Below `--bp-md` it should be static (already implemented in EventDetailView at the 880px breakpoint; normalising to `--bp-md` is the high-risk change tracked in PR 7).
- **All form inputs accept text** and the on-screen keyboard does not occlude the field being edited (test on a real iOS device, not just DevTools).
- **Food declaration callout, dietary tags, and capacity/waitlist badges remain legible.**
- **Cover image and emblem branding overlay render at the correct aspect ratio** without distortion.
- **ICS download / calendar links work** from a phone (tap behaviour, not just click).

## Verification checkbox

Every PR description in the `feat/mobile-friendly` track must include:

```
- [ ] Re-verified events RSVP baseline at 375px and 414px
```

For PRs that touch a mobile-frozen module or a shared token, extend to:

```
- [ ] Re-verified events RSVP baseline at 375 / 414 / 768 / 1024
- [ ] Screenshots attached for each flow
```

## Owed re-verifications

Changes already merged that have not yet been walked on real hardware. Clear the line when it is done, and do not let one reach prod unchecked.

- **Per-question character limits (`feat/form-question-limits`).** The long-text answer box moved onto the shared `CountedTextarea`, so it now renders through `Input.module.css` as well as this module. `FormRenderer.module.css` pins padding, font-size, min-height, line-height, the focus transition and the placeholder colour back to their previous values, but a counter row now sits under the box and CSS alone cannot answer whether the taller field still clears the iOS keyboard. A real-device walk of the RSVP flow at 375 and 414, and at 844 × 390 landscape, is owed before this reaches prod.

- **The RSVP bot gate.** `RsvpForm` mounts `RecaptchaInvisible`, so Google's floating badge sits on the public event page. It is `position: fixed` in the bottom-right corner and roughly 70 by 60 CSS pixels, which is the corner the sticky RSVP panel and the submit button share below `--bp-md`. No module in the frozen list changed, and no CSS did, so nothing here is expected to move; what is owed is an eye on whether the badge covers the submit button or the food callout at 375 and 414, and in landscape at 844 by 390 where it competes with the notch inset. The same badge has been on `/register` since sign-in was reworked, so the pattern is not new to the site, only to this flow.

## When the baseline itself should change

The baseline is not immutable — if a deliberate mobile improvement to the events flow is the goal of a PR, the new behaviour replaces the relevant entry above. Update this document in the same PR.

## Why no snapshot tests

No Playwright / Cypress / Chromatic harness exists in the repo. Standing one up just for this surface is a stage of its own and pulls CI infrastructure onto a public repo. Snapshot tests are also noisy on font loading and user-name strings that vary at test time. The hand-written baseline + a per-PR checkbox catches accidental coupling at the same scale as the site, with less ceremony. Revisit if Playwright lands for other reasons.
