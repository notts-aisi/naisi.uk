/**
 * Tell the owner when a scheduled check is not passing, by opening one issue
 * and keeping it up to date.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A scheduled run has no pull request to turn red and nobody
 * watching it; GitHub's own failure mail goes only to whoever last edited the
 * schedule line, and only if they have that mail switched on. A check that
 * fails where nobody looks is not a check.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. One issue per check, found by its label:
 *
 *   the check did not pass, no open issue    open one, assigned to the owner
 *   the check did not pass, issue open       add a comment (so it notifies again)
 *   the check passed, issue open             say so and close it
 *   the check passed, no open issue          nothing
 *
 * "Did not pass" means anything other than success: a failure, a cancelled
 * run, and a job that was SKIPPED. On a schedule a skip means the thing that
 * lets the check run is missing, which is the quietest failure of all and the
 * reason this reads the result rather than hooking `if: failure()`.
 *
 * WHAT THE ISSUE SAYS. That the check did not pass, and where the run is.
 * Nothing else. This repository is public; the detail stays in the run log.
 *
 * It talks to the GitHub API with the workflow's own token (`issues: write`)
 * and nothing else, so no third-party action and no extra secret is involved.
 * `tests/ci-alert-issue.test.mjs` drives `report` against a fake API.
