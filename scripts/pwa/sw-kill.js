/*
 * KILL SWITCH worker. The secondary rollback lever for the service worker.
 *
 * Use when the registrar itself is suspect (the primary lever is flipping
 * SERVICE_WORKER_ENABLED in src/features/pwa/config.ts). Deploy by copying
 * this file over public/sw.js and merging:
 *
 *     cp scripts/pwa/sw-kill.js public/sw.js
 *
 * Browsers see a byte-different sw.js on their next update check (update
 * checks bypass HTTP cache thanks to updateViaCache: "none" and the
 * no-cache header), install it, and on activate it deletes every cache on
 * the origin, unregisters itself, and reloads open windows so they are
 * controller-free immediately.
 *
 * The KILL SWITCH sentinel above is load-bearing: tests/pwa-offline-assets
 * .test.mjs requires it in this file, so keep it.
