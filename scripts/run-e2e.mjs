/**
 * `npm run e2e:browser` - the browser end-to-end suite in one command.
 *
 *   discover the spec modules -> seed each throwaway world -> drive them in
 *   Chromium -> tear every one down -> prove each manifest reads zero
 *
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs                       every spec, against dev
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --local               against a server it starts
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --local --skip-build  reuse the previous build
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --spec applicant-funnel,events-rsvp
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --list                what it can run
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --teardown            tear down whatever the ledgers name, nothing else
 *   node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --sweep <runId,...>   remove a run's rows and accounts WITHOUT a ledger
 *
 *   E2E_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:3100 node scripts/run-e2e.mjs --spec x
 *     against a loopback server ALREADY RUNNING (one somebody else started
 *     with --local, or by hand). Nothing is built or started, and the
 *     reCAPTCHA stub still arms because the origin is loopback.
 *
 * ## The spec modules are the source of truth, not a list in here
 *
 * Every `.mjs` under `scripts/e2e-fixtures/` except `core.mjs` exports one
 * `SPEC` object: its name, its spec file, its ordered step names, the subset
 * of those that cannot run against a deployed target, whether it needs an
 * admin account, whether it needs this run's mail CAUGHT, what it
 * covers, and seed / countRows / teardown. This file walks the directory and
 * validates the shape, so a new spec is covered by adding a file rather than
 * by remembering to edit a runner.
 *
 * ## A spec that must read its own mail says so, and is skipped rather than run
 *
 * `requiresCaughtMail: true` means the journey cannot be driven at all unless
 * the messages it causes land in the local Mailpit: the applicant sign-up
 * reads its confirmation and verification links OUT of the inbox, so against a
 * deployed backend there is no link to click and the run would only prove that
 * a page renders. Such a spec is SKIPPED where mail is not caught, with the
 * reason printed, and that is an accepted outcome rather than a shortfall.
 *
 * ## Teardown is unconditional, and the manifest is the proof
 *
 * Every fixture lives on a shared dev project, so a run that leaves rows
 * behind is a run that has polluted a real environment: a live-looking
 * admission round on the catalogue, a pre-course nobody scheduled, accounts in
 * the admin members list. Teardown therefore runs in a `finally`, on a
 * failure, and the exit code carries BOTH verdicts: a green suite whose
 * teardown left rows behind still exits non-zero, because the second fact is
 * as much a defect as the first.
 *
 * ## A run that drove no browser is a failure
 *
 * Everything a spec can do short of running exits `node --test` at 0: a
 * missing Playwright, a missing fixture, a skip. Three separate ways to get a
 * green command that opened nothing. So each spec writes a completion marker
 * naming the steps it finished, this file deletes those markers before the
 * run, and success requires each one back naming every step in its own
 * `SPEC.steps` (minus the reCAPTCHA-dependent set, and only against a deployed
 * target).
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not install Playwright, and it does not add it to `package.json`.
 * The root manifest is what App Hosting runs `npm ci` against on the critical
 * path of every production deploy, and a browser automation library plus a
 * downloaded Chromium has no business on that path (the same argument that
 * put `scripts/rules-tests` in its own package). So the runner CHECKS for
 * Playwright and REFUSES to run without it, printing the one-line install.
