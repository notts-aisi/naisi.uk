/**
 * Firestore access for Phase 2 — deliberately narrow, and a deliberate

 * Phase 1 asserted the harness never obtained a Firestore handle at all. Phase 2
 * cannot hold that line: its headline assertion is that
 * `users/{uid}.profile.uniEmailVerifiedAt` really landed, and only an Admin-SDK
 * read can prove it (the UI reads "verified" either way). So the guard was
 * loosened, as a reviewable diff, which was the point of putting it there.
 *
 * What replaces it, all enforced here at runtime and by
 * tests/e2e-no-privilege-grants.test.mjs offline:
 *  - Only two collections are reachable: `users` and `emailVerifications`.
 *  - A `users` document may only ever be written for a uid this harness
 *    created, and only with `role: "pending"` — the lowest role there is,
 *    which grants access to nothing. Never `member`, `committee`, `admin`,
 *    `suRecognised`, or a `permissions` map.
 *  - Every document written is recorded so teardown can remove it, and
 *    teardown re-verifies the account namespace before deleting anything.
