/**
 * Mailpit's HTTP API as an assertion surface (Phase 4).
 *
 * In local mode run.mjs points the app's SMTP at a Mailpit instance on
 * loopback, so "what email did that request cause?" becomes a queryable fact
 * instead of a thing nobody checks. Everything here is read/delete against
 * Mailpit's own API — no SMTP, no real mailboxes, nothing leaves the machine.
 *
 * Isolation model: assertions are PER-RECIPIENT, not "the whole mailbox".
 * Every fixture address embeds the per-run id, so concurrent batteries (and
 * leftovers from a crashed run) can never satisfy each other's waits. The only
 * global wipe is run.mjs's, once, before any test starts.
