/**
 * `fetch` for the calls the harness makes to SET UP or TEAR DOWN, as distinct
 * from the calls a battery asserts on.
 *
 * It retries ONCE, after a short pause, when no HTTP response arrived at all.
 * undici reports a reset socket, a refused connection and a failed DNS lookup
 * alike as `TypeError: fetch failed`, with the real code on `cause`, and
 * node:test prints only the message. One such failure inside a `before` hook
 * cancels the whole battery, and the log holds only "fetch failed". A response,
 * whatever its status, comes back untouched: a 4xx or a 5xx is the thing the
 * caller checks, and a repeated POST that had in fact been processed would be
 * a second write. The calls routed through here are safe to repeat when NO
 * response came back: a custom token exchanges as often as it is presented, a
 * session cookie minted twice is one orphan cookie, and Mailpit reads are
 * reads.
 *
 * The URL is printed without its query string, because the Identity Toolkit
 * calls carry the web API key there.
 *
 * `tests/e2e-harness-fetch-guard.test.mjs` is why every `fetch(` under
 * `scripts/e2e/lib/` goes through this and nowhere else.
