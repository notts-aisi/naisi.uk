 *   Firestore call here is `deleteHarnessUserDoc`, a DELETE of the users
 *   document belonging to an account this harness made, behind the same
 *   namespace check as the Auth deletion. The offline guard at
 *   tests/e2e-no-privilege-grants.test.mjs enforces both as build-time facts
 *   rather than conventions.
 * - Teardown refuses to delete any account whose email does not match this
 *   harness's own namespace, because a cleanup helper that trusted a uid
 *   argument could delete an account this harness did not create.
