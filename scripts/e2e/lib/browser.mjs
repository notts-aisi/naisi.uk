/**
 * Helpers for the BROWSER-driven specs under tests/e2e (the Playwright ones),
 * shared so every spec relaxes the same thing in the same way, and only on a
 * server this harness started itself.
 *
 * ## The reCAPTCHA stub, and why it is a stub rather than a test key
 *
 * `scripts/e2e/run.mjs` hands the local server Google's always-pass reCAPTCHA
 * SECRET, so `siteverify` accepts any token string. The fetch-based batteries
 * simply post a junk token. A browser cannot: the client widget
 * (`RecaptchaInvisible`) obtains its token from Google's `api.js`, and once a
 * secret is set the server treats a missing token as a refusal. Google's
 * published test SITE key does not help, because it is a v2 Checkbox key and
 * the widget renders as Invisible, which fails with "Invalid key type" and
 * yields nothing (the component's own comment says as much). The applicant
 * funnel's first two real runs both stopped there, at "We could not confirm
 * you are a person".
 *
 * So the relaxation is moved to where the fetch batteries already have it:
 * this helper intercepts the `api.js` request in Playwright and serves a
 * fifteen-line `grecaptcha` that calls back a fixed token, which the
 * always-pass secret then accepts. Nothing here touches product code, and
 * nothing here is reachable outside a Playwright page.
 *
 * ## It only arms on loopback
 *
 * Against a deployed target the server holds a REAL secret, a stubbed
 * token would be refused, and more importantly the point of dev mode is to
 * prove the real widget and the real secret agree. The helper therefore
 * checks the target origin and does nothing unless it is loopback, the same
 * test `lib/env.mjs` applies to the per-run token secret.

 *  - "bypass": the target is deployed and `.env.e2e.secrets.local` (or the
 *    environment) carries E2E_RECAPTCHA_BYPASS_SECRET. Every request from
 *    this page's context carries the bypass header, and the request that

 * 1. IT RECORDS WHAT RAN. Every way a spec can decline to run (no Playwright,
 *    no fixture, a skip) still exits `node --test` at 0, which is
 *    indistinguishable from a pass. So each step records its name as it
 *    finishes and `writeMarker()` writes the list; `scripts/run-e2e.mjs`
 *    deletes the marker before the run and refuses to report success unless it
 *    comes back naming every step in `SPEC.steps`.
 * 2. IT RECORDS WHAT DID NOT. A step this mode cannot run is skipped through
 *    node:test, so the output says so, and recorded under `skipped` with its
 *    reason, never under `steps`. The runner accepts exactly the reCAPTCHA
 *    set against a deployed target and nothing else.
 * 3. IT KEEPS THE PAGE. A selector timeout says what the spec wanted and
 *    nothing about what the page showed instead. On the funnel's first real
 *    run that difference was an afternoon: the apply form never appeared, and
 *    the reason (the route had refused the reCAPTCHA token) was only in the
 *    server log. So a step that throws leaves a screenshot, the page's text
 *    and the context's trace under `artifactsDir`, named after the step,
 *    before the failure is reported. Open the trace with
 *    `npx playwright show-trace <file>.trace.zip`: it holds a DOM snapshot
 *    before and after every action, so "what was under the pointer" and "what
 *    had the page done since the last step" are read off it rather than

/**
 * Signs in through the REAL /login form and waits for the app to take the
 * browser off it.
 *
 * Not a minted session cookie, which the auth harness can produce without a
 * browser and which is enough for a server component. It is NOT enough here:
 * the session picker, the drop-out card and every other client island read
 * `useAuth()`, so a cookie alone leaves them in their signed-out branch and a
 * spec would be testing nothing. Driving the form leaves the browser with real
 * Firebase Auth client state AND the cookie the server wants.
 *
 * ## Why it waits, now that the form no longer loses the race itself
 *
 * An earlier version filled the two boxes and pressed as soon as `#auth-email`
 * was in the DOM. That is right against a deployed build and lost two
 * different races against a dev server, both of which took whole spec runs
 * down with them. Five specs each wrote their own copy of the wait below
 * before it was moved here; this is that fix, once.
 *
 *  1. HYDRATION, which the product now answers rather than this helper. The
 *     two boxes are UNCONTROLLED (AuthEntry reads them out of the DOM when it
 *     needs them), so what is typed before React's first client render
 *     survives it; and the Sign in button carries `disabled` in the server
 *     markup until the form is live, so neither a press nor an Enter in a
 *     field can reach the browser's own submission. Both were the other way
 *     round until the hydration defects this suite found were fixed: the fill
 *     was wiped by React's first render, and a press reloaded /login with two
 *     blank fields and NO message on the form. So the fill goes in FIRST, on
 *     purpose, and the wait is for the button to lose `disabled`, which is the
 *     product's own public statement that the form is listening.
 *  2. THE ENTRANCE. AuthEntry parks the card at `translateX(112vw)` and slides
 *     it in when it clears `entering` (Google Identity Services reporting
 *     ready, or a 3.2 second fallback). A press while the card is still
 *     flying in does nothing at all: no request to identitytoolkit, no error,
 *     no navigation.
 *  3. THE READ-BACK, which is now an assertion instead of a retry loop. The
 *     two fields still holding what they were given, after the form has gone
 *     live, is the fact the other two waits are proxies for. It used to be
 *     refilled up to ten times because a controlled box could wipe it at any
 *     moment; a box that needs that today is a regression of the fix above,
 *     and this says so in one sentence rather than papering over it.
 *
 * Waiting on "the URL stopped being /login" rather than on a destination: a
 * role-pending account lands on /pending-approval and a member on the `next`
 * parameter, and which landing page a role gets is a decision no spec here has
 * a stake in. The handoff gets its own, more generous patience: it is four
 * things rather than one (Firebase mints an id token, /api/auth/session turns
 * it into a cookie, the app pushes at a route, and a dev server may still be
 * compiling that route while other specs keep it busy).
 *
 * The password is never logged, and never compared by value: the read-back
 * compares its LENGTH, so no failure message can carry it.
 *
 * ## The consent page, when the sign-in lands on it
 *
 * On a production build `(app)/layout.tsx` sends any account whose stored
 * `policyVersion` is behind `CURRENT_POLICY_VERSION` to `/re-consent` before
 * it renders a single authed page, so after a policy bump the handoff above
 * ends on the consent page rather than in the member area. That is the
 * product working, and the helper treats it the way a person does: it presses
 * the real Accept button, through `acceptReConsentIfAsked`, and waits for the
 * page's own navigation home. The account is then current in the same way a
 * member's is, by its own acceptance recorded through `/api/account/reconsent`,
 * which is why no fixture or spec ever stamps `policyVersion` with the Admin
 * SDK to get past the gate. The gate is off under `next dev`, so against a dev
 * server this branch is simply not taken.
 *
 * Returns `{ reconsented }`, true when the consent page was shown and accepted
 * on this sign-in, so a spec can assert that a stale account was asked exactly
 * once.
 *
 * @param {object} page              Playwright page.
 * @param {string} origin            The target origin.
 * @param {{email: string, password: string}} credentials
 * @param {{timeout?: number, handoffTimeout?: number}} [options]
 *   `timeout` is the patience for the first load and for every locator here.
 *   Pass a longer one on a DEV server, whose first request to a route compiles
 *   it. `handoffTimeout` is the patience for the URL leaving /login, and for
 *   the consent page's navigation home when it was shown.

 * this one.
 *
 * ## Press Approve, and let the card leave on its own
 *
 * The queue is a ONE-SHOT read rather than a live listener: `useOneShotList`
 * in src/features/admin/adminList.tsx fetches with `getDocs` on mount and
 * re-reads when its `reload()` is called. The Approvals page now hands that
 * `reload` to each card, so a card whose Approve has landed asks for the
 * re-read itself and the row goes with it. Waiting for the detach is therefore
 * the page agreeing the write happened, and no Refresh press is needed: an
 * earlier version of this helper pressed Refresh in a retry loop because the
 * page left the approved applicant sitting there under a stuck "Approving…"
 * button, which is the defect that fix closed.

/**
 * Counts the pointer events one element receives and records what was under
 * the pointer at each move, with listeners OUTSIDE React, installed
 * immediately before a drag and read back immediately after it.
 *
 * A painted array cannot tell "the moves never reached the element" (wrong
 * coordinates, something over it, capture sending them elsewhere) from "they
 * reached it and the component dropped them" (a state guard, a remount
 * between the button going down and the first move). The two send you into
 * different files. So the probe resolves the cell the same way the component
 * does, `elementFromPoint` at the event's coordinates, at the same instant,
 * and `sameNode` says whether the element the drag ended on is the one it
 * started on.
 *
 * `cell` is the selector a hit resolves up to, and `keys` the data attributes
 * that name one (`["day", "slot"]` prints `1:7`). A hit outside any cell
 * prints the tag it landed on instead, which is the whole point: `<span>`
 * names the column head that had moved under the pointer.
 *
 * This is a DIAGNOSTIC. It does not make a drag more reliable, and the
 * interaction guard (`tests/e2e-interaction-guard.test.mjs`) is why a spec
 * reaches for this rather than measuring coordinates of its own.
