/**
 * The magic-link token negatives — the cases nobody hand-tests, because
 * producing them by hand means forging an HMAC.
 *
 * All of these run unauthenticated against /api/verify-email/confirm, which is
 * a thin façade over confirmUniEmailVerification(). No email is sent and no
 * Firestore document is written on any path exercised here.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROL MATTERS MOST: "valid signature, unknown doc id" must
 * return 404, not 400. 404 means the server accepted our signature and got as
 * far as the Firestore lookup — which proves this harness reproduces the HMAC
 * byte-for-byte AND that the EVENTS_TOKEN_SECRET it mints with is the one the
 * target is running. Without it, every negative below could be passing merely
 * because our tokens are malformed, and the suite would be worthless while
 * looking green.
