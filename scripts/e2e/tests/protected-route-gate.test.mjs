/**
 * Pins the SERVER-SIDE contract that the client-side navigation fix depends on.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING A GREEN RUN. This file would have passed
 * throughout the entire lifetime of the bug it was written alongside, and it
 * will pass if that fix is reverted. It cannot catch the bug. The bug lives in
 * Next's client route cache — `router.replace` onto a URL that 307'd earlier
 * in the same document replays the recorded redirect with no network request —
 * and this harness is `node --test` + `fetch` with no browser, so there is no
 * route cache, no router, and no document here to break.
 *
 * What it DOES guard is the contract the fix reasons from, and whose silent
 * change would make that reasoning wrong without anyone noticing:
 *
 *   1. Protected routes 307 to /login?next=<path> when the cookie is absent.
 *      This redirect is what poisons the client route cache, and `?next=` is
 *      what src/app/(auth)/AuthEntry.tsx treats as evidence that a protected
 *      route already redirected in this document.
 *   2. POST /api/auth/session mints a real __session cookie. The self-heal's
 *      whole premise.
 *   3. With that cookie the PROXY GATE OPENS — the request is no longer sent
 *      to /login. This is the assertion that a console `fetch('/dashboard')`
 *      proved by hand while a user sat wedged on the login page.
 *   4. DELETE clears it and the gate closes again.
 *
 * Note on (3): a harness session deliberately has NO Firestore user document
 * (see lib/session.mjs), so it has no role and (app)/layout.tsx will bounce it
 * onward to /pending-approval. That is expected and fine — the assertion here
 * is specifically "not sent back to /login", i.e. the proxy's cookie check
 * passed. Asserting 200 would be asserting a role this harness has no business
 * creating.
 *
 * If this bug ever recurs, the only automated coverage that could catch it is
 * a real browser (Playwright), which this harness deliberately excludes.
