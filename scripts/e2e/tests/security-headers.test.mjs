/**
 * The response headers every route is meant to carry, asserted on a REAL
 * build.
 *
 * `next.config.ts` declares them, and a declaration is not a header until
 * a server has sent it: a rule with a `source` that does not match, a second
 * rule that overrides the first, a header the platform strips, none of those
 * shows up anywhere but on the wire. So this battery asks a running server,
 * on a page, on a redirect, on an API refusal and on the two static files
 * that carry rules of their own, and reads what came back.
 *
 * What it pins, and why each one:
 *
 *  - Strict-Transport-Security, two years with subdomains, so a first visit
 *    over http is the last one. (Browsers ignore it on a loopback http
 *    origin, but the header is still sent, and sent is what is asserted.)
 *  - X-Frame-Options DENY and `frame-ancestors 'none'`: nothing frames the
 *    site, so a clickjacking page has nothing to overlay.
 *  - Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin: the tokens in
 *    magic-link and unsubscribe URLs never reach a third-party image or
 *    embed as a referrer.
 *  - Permissions-Policy: camera, microphone, geolocation, payment, USB and
 *    the topics API are off for the page and every frame it embeds.
 *  - X-Content-Type-Options nosniff.
 *  - NO X-Powered-By. `poweredByHeader: false` in next.config.ts stops the
 *    framework naming itself on every response, which is the label a scanner
 *    sorts targets by when a framework bug is published.
 *  - Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only carrying the policy below, with no
 *    `'unsafe-inline'` in script-src, and no Content-Security-Policy header
 *    beside it. Changing that mode is a reviewed diff here as well as in
 *    next.config.ts.
 *  - The service worker keeps its no-store rule and the offline page its
 *    no-cache rule: a new global rule must not have replaced them.
 *
 * It proves headers, not handlers: the routes it requests are already
 * covered or written down elsewhere, and its AUTH_BATTERIES entry says so.
