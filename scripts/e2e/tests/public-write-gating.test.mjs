/**
 * PRODUCTION SAFETY CHECK — is the reCAPTCHA gate on the public RSVP really
 * live, on every deployed backend?
 *
 * `POST /api/events/[id]/rsvp` writes an `eventRsvps` row and posts a
 * NAISI-branded email to an address the caller typed. It is gated by
 * reCAPTCHA, but a source scan cannot see whether the gate is running on a
 * given backend, so this asks the server.
 *
 * ## What it proves, and what it does not
 *
 * It proves the gate is not OPEN: a junk token is refused. It cannot prove the
 * gate is not JAMMED SHUT, because `verifyRecaptcha` fails closed in
 * production when `RECAPTCHA_SECRET` is missing and a failed-closed gate
 * answers a junk token with exactly the same 400 as a working one. A backend
 * missing the secret, or missing the public site key so the form mounts no
 * widget, is therefore green here while every real RSVP on it is refused.
 * That direction is what the browser suite is for: the events RSVP spec drives
 * a guest through a real submission, and it runs in full against a local build
 * on every CI run. Said out loud because a battery that claims both directions
 * and delivers one is worse than one that claims the direction it has.
 *
 * The sibling `recaptcha-gate.test.mjs` asks the same question of
 * `/api/register`, and this file is deliberately its twin rather than an
 * addition to it: the two routes carry the secret independently, and a check
 * that proved one and implied the other is the assumption that lets the second
 * one drift.
 *
 * ## Why this is safe to point at production
 *
 * It posts a junk token to an event id that cannot exist, and the gate runs
 * BEFORE the event is fetched, so the request is refused at the captcha and
 * nothing is read, written or sent either way. A 404 back means the captcha did
 * NOT run first, and this skips loudly rather than guessing why: from out here
 * a backend that predates the gate and one whose gate has moved behind the
 * event lookup look identical. The ordering is pinned against the source by
 * `tests/public-write-gating.test.mjs`; liveness is what this file is for.
 *
 * Read-only, no credentials, no side effects. Runs on every `npm run e2e`.
