/**
 * /api/register must not leak whether an address already has an account.
 * The response has to be byte-identical for a fresh address, an existing
 * unverified one, and an already-verified one. This cannot be eyeballed — the
 * screen looks the same either way — and one added field silently destroys the
 * guarantee.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SKIPPED BY DEFAULT, and that is not laziness. Two hard blockers:
 *
 * 1. reCAPTCHA. /api/register is gated, and verifyRecaptcha() fails CLOSED in
 *    production mode. dev.naisi.uk therefore answers every request here with
 *    the same 400 regardless of account state, so running this against dev
 *    would "pass" while testing nothing. It needs a local server started with
 *    Google's always-pass test secret — that is Phase 3 of the design brief,
 *    and the brief is explicit that such a server is LOCAL ONLY and must bind
 *    to 127.0.0.1.
 *
 * 2. Real email. The fresh-address branch dispatches a verification email via
 *    the configured SMTP credentials. The fixtures are `.invalid` (RFC 2606,
 *    no DNS, no inbox) so nothing can reach a real recipient, but the send is
 *    still attempted; prefer SMTP redirected to a local catcher (Mailpit,
 *    Phase 4).
 *
 * `npm run e2e:local` arms it: run.mjs starts exactly that server (loopback
 * bind, always-pass secret in its environment only, SMTP pointed at Mailpit)
 * and sets E2E_ALLOW_REGISTER=1 for the test process.
 *
 * "Loopback target + E2E_ALLOW_REGISTER=1" is NOT sufficient on its own, and
 * the gate below does not stop there. Both are ambient-settable, so
 * `E2E_ALLOW_REGISTER=1 E2E_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:3000 npm run e2e` would
 * otherwise arm this against an operator's own `npm run dev`, a server whose
 * SMTP this harness has not pointed at Mailpit. The fixtures are `.invalid` so
 * no inbox could receive them, but the send would still be ATTEMPTED through
 * whatever SMTP that server is configured with. So the battery proves the
 * server's mail actually lands in Mailpit before it registers anything.
