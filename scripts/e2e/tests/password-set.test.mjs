/**
 * The verify-first register flow creates an account with a SERVER-RANDOM
 * throwaway password, and `/api/register/password-set` is where the user
 * replaces it after proving inbox ownership. If that replacement silently
 * failed, the account would keep a password nobody knows — the user would
 * appear registered, and every later sign-in attempt would fail with no
 * indication why.
 *
 * By hand this is close to unverifiable: the UI shows the same success screen
 * whether or not the credential actually changed. The only proof is asking
 * Identity Toolkit to sign in with each password.
 *
 * No email, no Firestore: the "throwaway" is set directly via the Admin SDK,
 * which is exactly what /api/register does with its randomBytes(24) value.

   * `password-set` calls Admin `updateUser({password})`, which bumps the

   * except one verifies with `checkRevoked: true`, so the caller's OWN
   * `__session` cookie is dead the instant their password is saved.
   *
   * That matters beyond this test: in the real email/password register flow,
   * `completeRegistration` later POSTs `/api/verify-email/reconcile` on that
   * same cookie — and reconcile is what stamps `profile.uniEmailVerifiedAt`
   * for anyone who clicked their uni-email link before the profile existed.
   * See uni-email-stamp.test.mjs for the paired test that drives that exact
   * sequence.
   *
   * This test pins CURRENT behaviour. If it starts failing because the cookie
   * survives, that is a deliberate change worth noticing, not a break.
