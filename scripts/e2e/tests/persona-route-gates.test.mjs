/**
 * THE STANDING RED TEAM: every route and every authed page, requested as
 * every persona, against a real build.
 *
 * WHY. The question is whether a gate's answer to persona X is what the
 * model says. A source guard can read the order of calls
 * (`tests/gate-before-data.test.mjs`) but not the answer; only a request can.
 * So this battery asks the question for every handler and every page, every
 * run, and `tests/persona-route-gates.registry.mjs` is the answer key a person
 * wrote.
 *
 * HOW. `scripts/e2e/run.mjs` starts a second copy of the build on
 * `E2E_PERSONA_ORIGIN`, pointed at a Firestore emulator, and
 * `scripts/e2e/lib/personas.mjs` seeds one account per persona THERE, so the
 * elevated roles never exist on the dev project (the harness's second
 * safety property stays literally true) and every route may be driven as
 * every persona, mutating ones included: what they mutate is the emulator.
 * Each route is requested with ids that address nothing and an empty JSON
 * body, so what comes back is the gate's answer or the first validation's,
 * and each page with `redirect: manual`, so a redirect is read rather than
 * followed. Every request carries its own forwarded address, because the
 * in-memory throttles would otherwise turn the later personas into 429s.
 *
 * RECORDING. With `E2E_PERSONA_RECORD=<path>` the battery writes what it
 * observed as JSON and asserts nothing but that every request answered. That
 * is how the registry was first written, and how a wholesale change is
 * re-keyed: record, read the diff as a list of decisions, edit the registry.
 *
 * SKIPPING. Without the two variables the runner sets (`E2E_PERSONA_ORIGIN`
 * and `E2E_PERSONA_EMULATOR_HOST`), the battery skips and says so, unless
 * `E2E_PERSONA_BATTERY=required`, which CI sets so a missing emulator is a
 * failed job rather than a quiet one. It never runs against a deployed
 * backend: there is no emulator behind one.
