/**
 * Phase 3: the local captcha-relaxed server, and the only supported way to run
 * the /api/register and Mailpit batteries.
 *
 *   npm run e2e:local             build, start, test, tear down
 *   npm run e2e:local -- --skip-build   reuse the previous local build
 *
 * What this script exists to guarantee, in order of importance:
 *
 * 1. The captcha-relaxed server is UNREACHABLE from anywhere but this machine.
 *    `next start` binds to every interface by default; a registration endpoint
 *    that accepts any reCAPTCHA token must never be LAN-visible, so the server
 *    is bound to 127.0.0.1 explicitly, and so is Mailpit.
 *
 * 2. The relaxation NEVER leaves this process. The always-pass secret and the
 *    Mailpit SMTP override are injected into the spawned server's environment
 *    only — no env file is written, so there is nothing a deployed backend
 *    could ever pick up. That is also why this script REFUSES a server that is
 *    already listening on the port: it constructs the server's environment
 *    itself rather than trusting whatever happens to be there.
 *
 * 3. The app under test is pointed at the DEV project. The assertion is on the
 *    EFFECTIVE environment, not just `.env.local`: Next resolves
 *    `process.env` > `.env.production.local` > `.env.local`, and the child
 *    inherits this shell, so the check reads the effective value. Mirrors the
 *    tripwires in lib/env.mjs.
 *
 * 4. No real mail can be attempted. SMTP_HOST/PORT are forced to the loopback
 *    Mailpit; the credentials in .env.local are shadowed, so even a template
 *    bug that addressed a real inbox would land in the catcher.

 * site key, and once a secret is set `verifyRecaptcha` treats a missing token

 * "Invalid key type" and still yields nothing (the second run found that).
 * The browser specs instead serve a stub `api.js` from Playwright on loopback
 * (`lib/browser.mjs`), which calls back a fixed token the always-pass secret
 * accepts; the key only has to be present for the widget to mount and ask.
