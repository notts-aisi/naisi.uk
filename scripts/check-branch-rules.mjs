/**
 * Branch rule guard: do `main` and `dev` on GitHub require what this file says
 * they require?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. What a branch requires before a merge is a setting on
 * GitHub, not a file in the repository. This is the same drift class as an
 * API key's restrictions or a project's sign-in providers, so it gets the
 * same treatment: the expectation is written down HERE, and the live setting
 * is compared with it.
 *
 * TWO LAYERS.
 *
 *  1. This file against the workflows. `tests/branch-rules.test.mjs` (offline,
 *     in `npm test`) requires every check named below to be a job that exists
 *     in `.github/workflows`, by its exact name. A required check whose job
 *     was renamed never reports, and every pull request then waits for ever.
 *  2. This file against GitHub. That is what running this script does. A
 *     public repository's rulesets are readable by anybody, so it needs no
 *     token and runs daily from `.github/workflows/config-drift.yml`.
 *
 * CHANGING A RULE is therefore a pull request: edit BRANCH_RULES, merge, then
 * apply it with an admin token so the setting matches the file again:
 *
 *   GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) node scripts/check-branch-rules.mjs --apply dev
 *
 * `--apply` rewrites exactly two things on the branch's ruleset, the list of
 * required checks and the code scanning rule, and leaves every other rule as
 * it finds it.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/check-branch-rules.mjs                  # compare both branches
 *   node scripts/check-branch-rules.mjs --apply main     # write, needs an admin token

 * decision with a date on it and not an omission, and the guard holds that a
 * check is in one list or the other, never both.
