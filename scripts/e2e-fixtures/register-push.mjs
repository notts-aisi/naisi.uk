/**
 * The register push fixture: one course, one running run three weeks in, one
 * group with nobody staffing it, and three members sitting in it.
 *
 * The journey it exists for is the ADMIN's, and the admin is an account the
 * harness is given (`needs.admin: true`, see scripts/e2e/README.md): this
 * harness may not mint a privileged identity, and it may not name a
 * facilitator either. `facilitatorUids` is EMPTY on purpose. An admin passes
 * `gateGroupRegister` on the admin branch, so every door onto the register
 * (GET, POST, PATCH, push, participant notes) opens for them without anybody
 * being appointed to anything.
 *
 * ## What the seed has to be true for the routes to do anything
 *
 * Four facts, each one load-bearing, each learned by reading the routes rather
 * than by guessing:
 *
 *  1. THE SESSIONS MUST HAVE HAPPENED. `columnsFor` only offers columns up to
 *     the cohort's current week, so a run starting today has one column and
 *     nothing to push. The run therefore starts 22 days ago on a four-week
 *     plan: the cohort is in week 4, four sessions have started, and the
 *     group's weekday is the start date's own weekday so every session falls
 *     on its slot's first day and every one of them is in the past.
 *  2. THE MEMBERS MUST HAVE JOINED IN WEEK 1. `joinedWeekNumber` scopes the
 *     grid: a cell before a member's joining week is inert and the routes
 *     refuse to write it. The enrol route stamps the CURRENT week, which for
 *     a run this far in would make weeks 1 to 3 unmarkable, so the enrolments
 *     are seeded rather than driven through the course page.
 *  3. THE NEXT WEEK MUST BE PUBLISHED. The push mails the group about the
 *     session AFTER the one being pushed, and refuses to send at all when
 *     that week's document is missing or unpublished ("Publish it and use the
 *     run's catch-up send"). So `courseRuns/{runId}/weeks/w02` is seeded
 *     published: it is the only week any part of this journey reads.
 *  4. THE MEMBERS MUST BE ON THE COHORT CHANNEL. `resolveCohortAudience`
 *     starts from `subscriptions` rows for `cohort:<runId>` and INTERSECTS
 *     them with active enrolments; an enrolment alone is not an audience.
 *     The enrol route writes that row, and this fixture writes it for the
 *     same reason it writes the enrolment.
 *
 * ## Mail
 *
 * Against a deployed target every fixture address is suppressed before
 * anything is seeded, and the push's audience derivation drops suppressed
 * addresses (`dropSuppressed` -> `filterSuppressed`) BEFORE it claims the send
 * marker, so nothing is mailed and nothing is claimed. Against the harness's
 * own server the mail is caught by Mailpit, the sends really happen, and the
 * `emailSends` rows they leave are what the spec reads to prove the push
 * mailed the group. Both answers are asserted; `state.suppress` is what the
 * spec branches on, and it is the runner's answer, never this module's.
 *
 * ## The one row that is addressed by somebody else's uid
 *
 * `reserveSendSlot` writes a throttle document at
 * `courseNudges/emailrate__push__{groupId}__{actorUid}` on every press of
 * push, and its only fields are the throttle's own bookkeeping: no runId, no
 * groupId, nothing this fixture can query on. So the seed resolves the admin
 * account's uid ONCE, from the address the harness is given for it, and keeps
 * the document id in its ledger. That is a READ of an account this harness did
 * not create and must never touch: the uid is used to address one document
 * under a fixture group id and for nothing else, and no teardown here goes
 * anywhere near the account itself.
