/**
 * The applicant funnel's fixture: a handful of fake applicants, one admission
 * round, and one open-enrolment pre-course with two capped groups.
 *
 * This is the worked example of a SPEC MODULE. Every file in this directory
 * except `core.mjs` exports one object named `SPEC` with the same shape, and
 * `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` discovers them by walking the directory:
 *
 *   name                    unique; the state and marker file stem
 *   specFile                the Playwright spec this fixture is for
 *   steps                   ordered step names, the spec's step() calls in order
 *   recaptchaDependentSteps the subset skipped against a deployed target
 *   needs                   { admin: boolean }
 *   covers                  { routes: [...], pages: [...] } the spec exercises
 *   seed({ runId, suppress, options, onState })  creates everything, returns
 *                           the state. It calls `onState(state)` BEFORE its
 *                           first write, so a seed that throws half way still
 *                           leaves the runner a ledger to tear down.
 *   countRows(state)        every kind of row and account, plus counts.total
 *   teardown(state)         removes everything, then returns countRows(state)
 *
 * Nothing runs at import time: `core.mjs` obtains no credential until a
 * function is called, so the coverage guard can import this module offline.
 *
 * ## Nothing it seeds can send mail against a deployed target
 *
 * The drop-out leg calls a route that emails the member
 * (`sendCourseDroppedOutEmail`). Fixture addresses are `.invalid` (RFC 2606),
 * so such a send cannot reach a person, but against the DEPLOYED dev backend
 * it would still be a real hand-off to Resend and a hard bounce logged against
 * the sending domain. So seeding writes a `suppressedEmails` row for every
 * fixture address FIRST, unless the runner says this run's mail is caught by
 * Mailpit.
 *
 * The check is universal: `sendEmail()` in `src/lib/email/send.ts` consults
 * the suppression list for every send and holds a suppressed recipient
 * (tests/email-suppression-chokepoint.test.mjs).
 * The per-feature helpers still check too: `sendCourseDroppedOutEmail()` in
 * `courseEnrolmentEmails.ts` returns early on `isSuppressed()` before it builds
 * a message, and `courseFacilitatorEmails.ts` drops suppressed addresses
 * through `filterSuppressed()`, and `tests/funnel-harness-guards.test.mjs`
 * keeps that second layer: it reads the email helpers the funnel's routes
 * import and fails if one of them stops
 * checking. The rows are self-identifying, ledgered, and removed by teardown
 * like everything else.
 *
 * The runner passes `suppress: false` only when it started the server itself
 * (or is driving the harness port), because only that server has had its SMTP
 * pointed at Mailpit on this machine. There the `emailSends` rows the sends
 * leave are what a spec reads to prove a route really sent, and those rows are
 * counted and drained by the manifest below like every other row this fixture
 * causes. Every other target, loopback or not, gets the suppression rows.
