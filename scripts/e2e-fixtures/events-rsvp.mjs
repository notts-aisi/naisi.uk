/**
 * The events RSVP smoke's fixture: one published public event, and one guest
 * address that has no account behind it.
 *
 * ## Why this spec exists
 *
 * The shared form renderer (`src/features/events/FormRenderer.tsx`) was
 * restructured in September 2026, and `docs/mobile-baseline-events.md` names
 * the public RSVP flow as the site's hard do-not-regress mobile surface while
 * also recording that the baseline is walked by hand and has an owed
 * re-verification outstanding. So this covers the two halves nobody has
 * re-checked together: a guest really can fill the form (custom question
 * included) and reach the confirmation page with a row and an email behind it,
 * and the same page really does fit a phone with its submit button reachable.
 *
 * ## No accounts at all
 *
 * The journey is a SIGNED-OUT one, which is the interesting one: an event is
 * public, a person who has never heard of NAISI opens it from a poster and
 * RSVPs. So this fixture creates no Auth user and no `users` document. What it
 * does create is an ADDRESS in the auth harness's namespace
 * (`harnessEmail()`), because everything downstream is keyed on that address:
 * the RSVP row, the confirmation email, the suppression row and every sweep in
 * teardown. An address inside the namespace is one `isHarnessAccount()` can
 * refuse to act on if a state file is ever stale or hand-edited, which is the
 * same protection the account-owning fixtures get.
 *
 * ## Suppression, and what it costs this spec
 *
 * `sendRsvpEmail()` checks the suppression list before it builds a message, so
 * a suppression row really does stop the send. Against a target whose server
 * can hand mail to Resend that is what we want: a `.invalid` address is a hard
 * bounce logged against the sending domain. Where the mail is CAUGHT (a server
 * the runner started, or the reserved harness port) suppression is off and the
 * `emailSends` row the route logs is the evidence the spec reads. The spec
 * asserts the row exists in the first case and asserts none exists in the
 * second, so neither mode is a mode where the email leg proves nothing.
 *
 * Nothing runs at import time: `core.mjs` obtains no credential until a
 * function is called, so the guard test can import this module offline.
