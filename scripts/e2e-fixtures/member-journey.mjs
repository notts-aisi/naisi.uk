/**
 * The member journey's fixture: one throwaway course with an open-enrolment
 * run, two capped session slots, two throwaway accounts, and the subscription
 * rows one of them starts out holding.
 *
 * The spec it feeds (`tests/e2e/member-journey.spec.mjs`) is the one that
 * crosses the approval boundary: an admin approves a waiting applicant on the
 * real Approvals page, and everything after that is driven as the member who
 * was just made one. See `applicant-funnel.mjs` for the worked example of the
 * SPEC contract; this file follows it exactly.
 *
 * ## Nothing here writes a role, and the member is made one through the page
 *
 * The fence forbids this harness creating anything above role `pending`, and
 * that includes the account this journey is about. So the fixture seeds two
 * ordinary pending accounts and the SPEC promotes the first of them by
 * pressing Approve as the admin, which is also the only way this suite covers
 * the Approvals page at all. Reading the role back afterwards is a read of
 * something the PRODUCT wrote, which is the whole point of the step.
 *
 * ## Why the second account is not seeded as an enrolment
 *
 * The one-place session has to be FULL before the member tries to move into
 * it, and the cheapest way to write that would be a `courseEnrolments` row and
 * a `memberCount` of 1. This fixture does not do that, for two reasons:
 *
 *  - `memberCount` without a row behind it is a lie in the data, and the
 *    picker's "Full" would then be reading a number nobody earned.
 *  - the enrol route admits a `pending` caller ON PURPOSE (its own module
 *    comment says so), so a second throwaway account can take that last seat
 *    through the real route, in a real browser, with no privilege at all.
 *
 * The counter therefore moves because somebody signed up, which is the same
 * reason it moves in production, and the "Full" the member meets is real.
 *
 * ## Mail on this journey
 *
 * Two sends sit on it: the application-approved email the Approvals page
 * fires, and the drop-out email the enrol route's DELETE fires. Both are
 * stopped by the suppression rows this fixture writes before it seeds:
 * `sendCourseDroppedOutEmail` returns early on `isSuppressed()`, and the
 * approval send goes through `sendEmail()`, which drops suppressed recipients
 * at the send chokepoint.
 *
 * A send withheld for a suppressed address leaves an `emailSends` row at
 * status `suppressed`.
 *
 * Both addresses' `emailSends` rows are counted and drained below either way,
 * so the manifest tells the truth about what this run caused.
 *
 * Nothing runs at import time: `core.mjs` obtains no credential until a
 * function is called, so the coverage guard can import this module offline.
