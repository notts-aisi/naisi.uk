/**
 * The shared floor every browser end-to-end fixture stands on.
 *
 * One spec module per file beside this one, each exporting a single `SPEC`
 * object (see `applicant-funnel.mjs` for the worked example and
 * `scripts/run-e2e.mjs` for the runner that discovers them). This file holds
 * everything those modules have in common: the collection allowlist and its
 * chokepoint, the only two ways to reach Firestore, the id restatements, the
 * account helper, and where scratch files live.
 *
 * ## Why the fence lives here rather than in each module
 *
 * `tests/e2e-no-privilege-grants.test.mjs` holds the AUTH harness to three
 * Firestore collections, because that harness only ever proves things about
 * registration. A browser fixture needs admission rounds, course runs and the
 * rows the routes create under them, so it cannot live inside that fence
 * without tearing the fence down.
 *
 * It therefore sits outside and carries its own fence, of the same shape,
 * asserted at runtime here and offline by `tests/funnel-harness-guards.test.mjs`:
 *
 *   - Every collection any fixture may address is a literal in
 *     `FIXTURE_COLLECTIONS`, checked by `assertFixtureCollection()` before any
 *     credential is obtained.
 *   - No fixture creates a privileged identity. Accounts are the auth
 *     harness's own `createHarnessUser` plus its `seedPendingUserDoc`, whose
 *     role is the hard-coded literal "pending". There is no code path in this
 *     tree that writes a role, a `permissions` map, `suRecognised`, or a
 *     custom claim.
 *   - Nothing here runs against a project that is not the dev project,
 *     through the auth harness's own `loadEnv()`. There is no emulator escape
 *     hatch: one keyed off FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST alone would point the
 *     documents at a local database while creating the Auth accounts for real.
 *   - Every document a fixture writes is ledgered in its own state file, and
 *     teardown proves the ledger drained by counting the rows again.
 *
 * ## Nothing here runs at import time
 *
 * No `loadEnv()`, no Firestore handle, no file read. The coverage guard imports
 * every module in this directory offline, with no credentials and no env file,
 * to read its `SPEC`; a module that reached for a credential on import would
 * make that impossible and would move the project assertion out of the one
 * place it belongs.
 *
 * ## Ids are constructed, never parsed
 *
 * Every fixture id is `{slug}__{runId}`, the repo's `slugId` shape with the
 * random suffix replaced by this run's id, so a crashed run is sweepable by
 * eye and by query. Nothing here ever splits an id back apart to recover the
 * run id: the state file under `.e2e-state/` is the record, and the run id
 * field on every document is the query key.
