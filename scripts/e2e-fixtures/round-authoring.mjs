/**
 * Round authoring: the admin makes an admission round from nothing, fills it
 * until the readiness panel is green, opens it, and the public apply page
 * shows it.
 *
 * ## What this fixture seeds, and what the PRODUCT creates
 *
 * Almost nothing is seeded, on purpose. The round, its first stage, its dates,
 * its question, its reviewers and its status are all created by the admin
 * pressing the console's own controls, which is the whole point of the
 * journey: a fixture that wrote a finished round and then checked the panel
 * agreed would be testing the panel against a document this file invented,
 * not against the authoring routes.
 *
 * One thing cannot be authored from inside the round, so it is seeded: an
 * enrolment round's readiness bar includes "there is somewhere to place the
 * people you accept", which is satisfied by naming an OUTCOME RUN, and a
 * course run is a different object with its own editor. So the seed writes one
 * throwaway course and one throwaway run under it, in the applicant funnel's
 * shapes, and the spec picks that run in the outcomes section the way an admin
 * would. Everything else on the round is the product's work.
 *
 * ## Teardown sweeps the round by its LABEL
 *
 * The round's id is `slugId(label)`, so the harness cannot know it before the
 * browser has pressed Create, and the spec runs in a different process from
 * the teardown. The label is therefore the key: the seed decides it, writes it
 * into the ledger, the spec types exactly that string into the New round form,
 * and teardown sweeps `admissionRounds` by `label ==` it. It carries the run
 * id, so it cannot collide with another run or with a real round, and the
 * query is a single equality, which needs no index.
 *
 * ## The one write this manifest cannot count, said out loud
 *
 * `PUT /api/admissions/rounds/[roundId]/roles` also stamps
 * `users.admissionsReviewer = true` on everybody it appoints, and clears it on
 * everybody it un-appoints who is not still named on another round. That is a
 * field on a REAL person's user document: the harness may not create an
 * eligible reviewer (it may not write any role above `pending`), so the only
 * people the picker can offer are accounts that already exist.
 *
 * Three things follow, and all three are deliberate:
 *
 *  1. The spec appoints an ADMIN and nobody else. It reads the picker's own
 *     role hint and refuses to appoint an SU-recognised committee member,
 *     because that would hand a real capability (reading applications) to
 *     somebody who did not have it. An admin already holds every power the
 *     appointment grants, so appointing one grants nothing new.
 *  2. The spec takes them back off again through the same picker, as its last
 *     step, which is what makes the route clear the flag. That is asserted
 *     rather than assumed: the readiness panel going back to "at least one
 *     reviewer is appointed: still to do" is the console agreeing that
 *     `reviewerUids` is empty, and the flag is cleared in the same batch.
 *  3. `users` is outside this fixture's fence by design, so the manifest below
 *     cannot count that field, and does not pretend to. If the spec fails
 *     between the appointment and the un-appointment, the flag is left true on
 *     an admin's document. The route's own note says what that costs: the flag
 *     is a nav hint, every admissions route re-checks the round's arrays, so a
 *     stale `true` grants nothing and costs a sidebar link until the next run
 *     of this spec, or any other roles save, clears it.
 *
 * ## Nothing here can send mail
 *
 * No route this spec drives sends anything: creating, patching, staging,
 * appointing and opening a round are all silent. The one control on the page
 * that does send, `Send due reminders now`, is deliberately NOT pressed: it
 * writes the scheduler's bookkeeping to `config/scheduler`, which is live
 * shared configuration that this fixture may not address and could not put
 * back. The spec reads that button's disabled state instead, which is a real
 * assertion (the manual reminder lane is shut on a draft round) and no write.
 *
 * So `suppress` changes nothing here. It is still recorded in the ledger,
 * because the runner decides it and a fixture that quietly dropped the answer
 * would be the wrong place to discover that a later step had started sending.
