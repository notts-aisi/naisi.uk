/**
 * The sign-up spec's fixture: ONE admission round, and nothing else.
 *
 * Every other browser fixture in this directory seeds the accounts its spec
 * signs in with. This one deliberately does not. The journey under test is a
 * person who has never had an account meeting NAISI for the first time on an
 * apply link, so the account has to be made BY THE PRODUCT: `/api/register`
 * creates the Auth user, the emailed magic link verifies it and mints the
 * session, `/api/register/password-set` gives it a credential, and the
 * register form's own client write creates `users/{uid}` at role `pending`.
 * A seeded account would skip all four and leave the spec proving that a form
 * renders rather than that somebody can join.
 *
 * The addresses ARE decided here, at seed time, and written to the ledger,
 * because teardown runs in the runner's process and has to be able to find
 * everything the routes created without the spec telling it anything. They are
 * the auth harness's own namespaces: `e2e-<id>@e2e.invalid` for the sign-in
 * address (RFC 2606, undeliverable everywhere) and
 * `e2e-<id>@nottingham.ac.uk` for the university address the eligibility check
 * demands, both keyed on this run's id so no other run and no person can own
 * one.
 *
 * ## Why there are no `suppressedEmails` rows here, and what stands in
 *
 * Every other fixture writes a suppression row per address before it seeds, so
 * a run against the deployed dev backend cannot hand a message to Resend.
 * Suppression is the wrong instrument HERE, and would be worse than nothing:
 * this journey has to READ its own mail. The confirmation link makes the
 * account and the verification link proves the university address, so a
 * suppressed send is a spec with no link to click, and a suppression row would
 * read, to the next person, like the protection the other fixtures have.
 *
 * What keeps this spec off a real sender is that it declares
 * `requiresCaughtMail: true`, and the runner SKIPS it, with the reason
 * printed, wherever `mailIsCaught()` says the messages could really go. That
 * is the whole protection and it is one line.
 *
 * Two things still stand behind it, both belt and braces:
 *
 *  - The spec refuses to press the register button at all unless the runner
 *    said this run's mail is CAUGHT (`state.suppress === false`, which
 *    `mailIsCaught()` only answers for a server this harness started or the
 *    port reserved for one). Pointed at an ordinary `npm run dev` on :3000,
 *    which is on the target allowlist, it fails loudly rather than sending.
 *  - Before the `@nottingham.ac.uk` address is typed anywhere, the spec proves
 *    a `.invalid` message really reached the local Mailpit, the same gate
 *    scripts/e2e/tests/uni-email-inbox.test.mjs applies for the same reason:
 *    a real domain must never be addressed by a server whose SMTP might be
 *    real.
 *
 * ## What it cannot drain, said out loud
 *
 * `signupMetrics` holds one shared daily counter document per date, which
 * `/api/register` increments. It is not on the fixture's collection list and
 * must not be: draining it would corrupt a real number that other runs and
 * real registrations contribute to on the same day. So a run of this spec
 * leaves the counters a fraction higher, exactly as a person clicking through
 * registration does. Everything else it causes is counted below and
 * removed by teardown.
