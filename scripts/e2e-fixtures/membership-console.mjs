/**
 * The membership console's fixture: one throwaway account for an admin to
 * record a membership against, and a snapshot of the one document on the dev
 * project this spec is allowed to move.
 *
 * The period itself is NOT seeded. Creating it is the first thing the journey
 * does, through the console, because "an admin can create a membership period"
 * is one of the two things this spec is here to prove. So the period is a
 * ROUTE-CREATED row that the manifest below counts and teardown sweeps, keyed
 * on a label this fixture chose.
 *
 * ## The dangerous part, said plainly
 *
 * "Make current" rewrites `config/membership`, and that pointer is what every
 * membership badge on the dev site reads: the console's own Current chip, the
 * chips on the admin Members rows, and `GET /api/membership/me`. It is real
 * configuration.
 *
 * So the fixture treats it as borrowed rather than as its own:
 *
 *  - `seed()` SNAPSHOTS the document before anything is written, through
 *    `membershipConfigDoc()`, which is the only way into the `config`
 *    collection this harness has (`fixtureDoc` refuses every other id there,
 *    and `fixtureQuery("config")` refuses outright).
 *  - The snapshot goes in the state file, so the process that tears down is
 *    never a different process with a different idea of what was there.
 *    Firestore values do not survive JSON on their own, so they are encoded
 *    field by field and decoded back; a value this fixture cannot encode makes
 *    seeding REFUSE rather than promise a restore it cannot perform.
 *  - `teardown()` puts it back with a full `set()` (never a merge, which would
 *    leave this run's `updatedAt` and `updatedByUid` behind), or DELETES the
 *    document when there was none before.
 *  - `countRows()` counts 1 while the live pointer differs from the snapshot,
 *    so a run that moved the pointer and failed to move it back cannot report
 *    a manifest of zero. That is the number the runner's exit code is built
 *    on, and a pointer left on a fixture period is exactly the kind of damage
 *    a manifest reading zero must never hide.
 *
 * ## The period id is a YEAR, so it cannot carry the run id
 *
 * `POST /api/admin/membership/periods` derives the document id from the
 * academic year (`2094/95` becomes `2094-95`) and writes with `create()`, so
 * the id is not this fixture's to namespace. It uses a year far enough out
 * that no real period can collide with it, and the LABEL carries the run id,
 * which is what teardown sweeps on. A document already sitting at that id is
 * dealt with before anything is written: cleared when its label says a
 * previous run of this fixture made it, refused loudly when it does not.
 *
 * ## Nothing here sends mail
 *
 * `POST /api/admin/membership/grant` writes a row, a cache entry and two
 * counters, and sends nothing; neither does the periods route or the current
 * route. The `emailSends` sweep below is therefore expected to find nothing,
 * and it runs anyway: a route that grows a notification email later should
 * show up in this manifest rather than as rows nobody counted.
 *
 * The manifest alone would not be enough to SAY that, though. Teardown sweeps
 * `emailSends` for the fixture address before the runner takes its only
 * enforced count, so a notification added to the grant route later would be
 * created and swept with a manifest still reading zero. The spec therefore
 * asserts the absence itself, in both suppression modes, as its last step: a
 * membership recorded by an admin is not news to the member, and the day that
 * changes it should be a decision somebody made rather than a send nobody
 * noticed.
