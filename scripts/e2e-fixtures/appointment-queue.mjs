/**
 * The appointment queue's fixture: one facilitator round with two submitted
 * applications on it, and one run somebody can be appointed onto.
 *
 * ## Why the applications are seeded rather than driven
 *
 * The applicant funnel drives the apply leg for real, and that leg is
 * reCAPTCHA-gated: it only runs against a local server with the always-pass
 * secret. This spec is about the DECIDER's screen, so it seeds the two
 * submitted applications with the Admin SDK, exactly in the shape the apply
 * and submit routes leave behind (`tx.create` in
 * `/api/admissions/rounds/[roundId]/apply` plus the `tx.update` in
 * `.../apply/submit`), and drives everything from `/admin/admissions/[roundId]/
 * appointments` onwards through the browser. That is what lets it run against
 * a deployed target as well as a local one.
 *
 * ## The round names nobody
 *
 * `reviewerUids` is empty and `finalDeciderUid` is null, exactly as the
 * funnel's round is, because this harness may never mint round authority.
 * `canDecideAppointments` admits an admin regardless of either field, so an
 * admin account the harness is given decides, which is also the shape a real
 * facilitator round takes on the evening it closes.
 *
 * ## What the decide route writes, and what this therefore counts
 *
 * Reading `/api/admissions/rounds/[roundId]/decide` end to end, one appointment
 * writes: the application's status and outcome; the round's two counters; the
 * uid onto the run's facilitator list; one `courseAudit` row; and, after the
 * commit, one `admissions` send to the applicant. A decline writes the first
 * two and the send. The push mirror writes nothing without VAPID configuration,
 * which no harness server has. Every one of those is either a document this
 * fixture deletes outright (the round, the run, the applications) or a row the
 * manifest below counts and sweeps (`courseAudit`, `emailSends`).
 *
 * ## Mail
 *
 * Both decisions email the applicant, so seeding writes a `suppressedEmails`
 * row for every fixture address FIRST unless the runner says this run's mail
 * is caught by Mailpit. `sendAdmissionEmail` returns early on `isSuppressed()`
 * before it builds a message, which is what makes that a no-mail promise
 * rather than a hope. Where the mail IS caught, the `emailSends` rows the two
 * sends leave are what the spec reads to prove the route really sent, and they
 * are counted back to zero like everything else.
