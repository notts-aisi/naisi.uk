/**
 * Rules tests for the worksheets feature (docs/worksheets.md).
 *
 * The suite is written MEMBER-FIRST and persona-by-persona, because admins
 * take a resource-independent branch of nearly every rule in this file: an
 * admin can list unfiltered, read a private worksheet and reach any response,
 * so a suite that proved the feature works for an admin would have proved
 * nothing at all about the people who actually use it.
 *
 * The properties that must hold, in rough order of blast radius:
 *
 *  - A RECIPIENT NEVER SEES A SCORE. Reviews are their own subcollection with
 *    the recipient off the read list, so this is one rule rather than two that
 *    have to agree.
 *  - A SUBMITTED RESPONSE IS FROZEN. The gate reads the STORED state, so a
 *    recipient cannot write 'started' back over 'submitted' and edit answers
 *    the reviewers have already read.
 *  - ONE RECIPIENT NEVER ENUMERATES ANOTHER'S ANSWERS. The response doc id is
 *    the recipient's uid, which makes their own get legal and their list of
 *    the subcollection refused.
 *  - THE SHAPE RULES ARE REAL. Firestore judges a list on the query's shape,
 *    not on the rows it returns, so a committee library list must carry
 *    `where("private", "==", false)` and a staff circulation list must carry
 *    `where("staffUids", "array-contains", uid)`. Both are pinned here in BOTH
 *    directions: with the clause it is allowed, without it, refused.
 *  - CIRCULATIONS AND RESPONSES ARE ROUTE-WRITTEN. No client create, no client
 *    delete, admins included, because each one carries a task, a counter and a
 *    send with it.
 *  - `private` IS ADMIN-ONLY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AND AT BOTH CREATE AND UPDATE.
 *    Pinning it at update alone would let a committee member create the
 *    worksheet private and walk past the gate.
 *  - DELETING A WORKSHEET IS A ROUTE TOO, since the deletion work landed. The
 *    author is still the person who may do it, but a document delete strands
 *    the question images in Storage and cannot ask whether a circulation of
 *    the worksheet is still open, so the client delete closed and the
 *    permission moved into the route. The refusals for every hat, admins
 *    included, are in member-records.test.mjs.
