/**
 * Rules tests for THE SCHEDULE ITSELF — who may move a run's dates, its week
 * plan and its status client-direct, and which checks the rules make when they
 * do.
 *
 * `courses.test.mjs` covers write AUTHORISATION for the courses feature. This
 * file covers the narrower question of the run's `startDate` and `weekPlan`,
 * the two fields every derived week number, every attendance column, every
 * nudge slot key and every mirrored task id are computed from. A track lead
 * writes them **client-direct**, with no server route in the path, so the
 * rules are the only validation they get.
 *
 * Tests whose title starts **GUARD** pin a property the rules really hold.
 * Loosen the rule and they go red.
 *
 * Namespace: `courses-schedule` (see `getTestEnv` — one project id per file, or
 * a parallel file's `clearFirestore()` wipes these fixtures mid-test).
