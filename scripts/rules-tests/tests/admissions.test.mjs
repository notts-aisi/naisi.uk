/**
 * Rules tests for the SIX ADMISSIONS COLLECTIONS (V3 W1).
 *
 *   admissionRounds
 *   admissionRounds/{roundId}/stages/{stageId}
 *   admissionApplications
 *   admissionApplicationPrivate
 *   admissionReviews
 *   memberConductFlags
 *
 * Every one of them is `allow read, write: if false`. A file that only
 * asserted "deny denies" would be worth nothing, so what is actually pinned
 * here is narrower and sharper:
 *
 *  1. **The reads that would have looked reasonable are refused.** Four of
 *     the six had a plausible own-row or signed-in read in the original
 *     design, and each was dropped for a specific reason. An applicant
 *     reading their OWN application row is the one that matters most: it
 *     carries `evidence.facilitatorNotes` and an `outcome.reason` the decider
 *     deliberately did not tick to share. Those cases are tested as the
 *     actor who would have held the read, not as a stranger.
 *  2. **Admins are refused too, on every collection and every verb.** These
 *     are route-owned collections whose invariants (counters moving with a
 *     status, a self-review guard, a server-recomputed total) live in Admin
 *     SDK code. An admin who can write them from a browser is an admin who
 *     can break them from a browser.
 *  3. **Creates are attempted at WELL-FORMED deterministic ids.** A create at
 *     `garbage-id` proves almost nothing: the ids here are constructible by
 *     anyone who knows a round id and their own uid, so the test uses the
 *     real `${roundId}__${uid}` shapes. A rule that leaked would leak to
 *     exactly this request.
 *  4. **No question text sits on a client-readable document.** This is the
 *     timed-release guarantee, and it is not a rule you can assert by
 *     reading rules: it is a property of where fields are put. The scanner
 *     below walks the seeded fixtures, works out which are readable by
 *     probing an actual member client, and fails if a readable one carries a
 *     `questions` key. It is self-verified: one test plants a leak and
 *     asserts the scanner catches it.
 *  5. **A 25-document list on a readable sibling still works.** The
 *     regression against a `get()` creeping into a read rule; see the
 *     comment on that test for exactly what it does and does not prove.
 *
 * ## Mutation check (each restored bit-exact afterwards)
 *
 *  1. `admissionApplications` changed to
 *     `allow read: if isSignedIn() && resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid`
 *     → the own-row refusal test goes red, everything else green.
 *  2. `admissionRounds` changed to `allow read: if isSignedIn()` → the round
 *     read tests go red.
 *  3. The `.../stages/{stageId}` match block deleted entirely → the stage
 *     tests stay GREEN, because subcollections fall to deny-by-default. That
 *     is the tell that the block is there for the day somebody adds a
 *     wildcard above it, and it is why the scanner in (4) exists as well.
 *  4. `memberConductFlags` changed to `allow read: if isAdmin()` → the
 *     admin-refusal test goes red.
 *  5. A `questions` field added to the ROUND fixture → everything stays
 *     GREEN, and that is correct rather than a hole: the round is
 *     unreadable, so the questions are not on the wire. Add (1)'s sibling
 *     mutation on top of it (`admissionRounds` relaxed to
 *     `allow read: if isSignedIn()` WITH the fixture change) and the
 *     scanner goes red alongside the read tests. That pair is the real
 *     property: the guarantee is not "no questions on a round", it is "no
 *     questions anywhere a client can reach", and the scanner tracks the
 *     rules rather than a list of collections someone has to remember to
 *     update.
 *
 * If you edit any of those clauses, redo it: a pin nobody has watched fail is
 * a comment.
