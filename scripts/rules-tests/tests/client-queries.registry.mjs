/**
 * The registry behind `client-queries.test.mjs`: one entry per distinct
 * (file, collection path, clause set) READ that `src` issues through the
 * Firestore client SDK, and, for every entry, who is allowed to run it.
 *
 * WHY A REGISTRY RATHER THAN A LIST OF ASSERTIONS. Firestore judges a `list`
 * or a `listen` by the QUERY'S SHAPE, not by the rows it returns: a query
 * whose shape could match a document the rule forbids is refused wholesale,
 * silently, and with no document in the collection needed to trigger it. An
 * admin never sees that happen, because every rule in `firestore.rules` gives
 * an admin a resource-independent branch that matches the whole collection.
 * So the failure lands on exactly the people nobody tests as, and it lands as
 * an empty panel rather than an error.
 *
 * Each entry therefore states, in one place: the shape as the scanner reads it
 * out of `src`, the gate the caller sits behind, the concrete executable form
 * (`run`) with the fixtures it needs (`seed`), and an outcome for EVERY base
 * persona, so no audience is left silent. A "refused" here is a decision
 * somebody wrote down, not an absence.
 *
 * HOW TO ADD ONE. The test fails with the file, line and shape of any read it
 * cannot match, and fails again if an entry no longer matches anything in
 * `src`. Copy the shape out of that failure, name the gate honestly (open the
 * page's `layout.tsx`, do not guess), and give every base persona an outcome.
 * If a persona who can reach the page comes back "refused", that is a finding
 * to raise, not a line to write down and move past.
 *
 * COUNT AGGREGATIONS. `getCountFromServer` is judged on the same shape as the
 * equivalent `list`, so the three count sites here are proven with a `get()`
 * of the identical query. The entry says so in its reason.
 *
 * LISTENS. Around forty entries stand for `onSnapshot` sites. A listen is
 * judged on the same shape as the equivalent `list`, so every one of them is
 * executed as a `get()` of the identical query, and that substitution is the
 * only way in which the executable form differs from the source.
 *
 * SHARED KEYS. An entry may share its scanner key (file, path, clauses) with
 * one other entry when the FIXTURE is the interesting variable: the two
 * `adminLocks` id shapes, and a task the viewer is and is not on. The stale
 * check then sees the key through either entry, so both carry
 * `sharesKeyWith` and the suite checks the pair is symmetric.
 *
 * UNRESOLVED ENTRIES carry `pins`: the literal call-site text each declared
 * shape was read from, checked against `src` on every run, because the
 * scanner cannot match those shapes and prose alone would never go stale.
 * `UNRESOLVED_SITE_COUNTS` at the foot of the file states how many unreadable
 * reads each declared file carries, so a second one cannot ride the first.
 *
 * SINGLE-DOCUMENT READS evaluate against `resource.data`, so their entries
 * carry a `docShape` naming which document the fixture stands for, and their
 * `seed` writes it. A missing document is not neutral: a rule that
 * dereferences `resource.data` refuses a read of a document that does not
 * exist, which is consequence 3 in docs/courses-ops.md.
 */

/**
 * The hats a read can be issued under. `uid` is used even for the signed-out
 * visitor, so an entry's `run` never has to branch: it addresses a document id
 * that simply has no owner.
 *
 * The six base personas are mandatory on every entry. The permission variants
 * are opt-in, and belong on any entry whose rule keys off `users.permissions`,
 * because that is the axis on which a plain member reaches a staff surface.

The two pages whose gate is wider than the rule both mount the hook inside a child that only a caller the rule admits renders: RunEditor under /admin/courses (gate: admin, draftCourse or approveCourse) mounts it in GroupsAndRolesWithRoster, for an admin or an SU-recognised committee member, and RoundEditor under /admin/admissions (gate: admin, approveCourse, or an appointed admissions reviewer, who may hold no key at all) mounts it in RolesEditor, for an admin. A plain member on either page therefore never fires this list. What they see instead: RunEditor replaces the Roles pickers with a note naming who can appoint, and RoundEditor replaces its Reviewers section with a read-only summary. One picker stays drawn from an empty roster, the per-group facilitator picker inside GroupEditor, which is out of the split's reach because closing it out would take the rest of the group card with it; it still counts a group's facilitators but cannot name them, a second note on that card says so, and saving cannot silently drop them because GroupEditor writes the facilitator list only when it changed. Neither split is left to a reviewer's memory: `tests/roster-read-gates.test.mjs` walks every call site of every hook that lists `users` and fails if one drifts back into the page component, or if a new caller appears with no gate written down.
