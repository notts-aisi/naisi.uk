/**
 * Rules tests for the notification grid stored on `users.profile.notifications`
 * (V3 W3 PR32, extended for the per-category grid).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists when the rules did not change
 *
 * The grid saves client-direct: the profile form writes the whole
 * `profile.notifications` map, and single cells save on toggle under
 * `profile.notifications.categories.*` and `profile.notifications.push.*`.
 * That depends on the users self-update rule pinning named FIELDS (`role`,
 * `tracks`, `permissions`, `suRecognised`, `admissionsReviewer`,
 * `paidMembershipYears`, `email`, the consent pair, the uni email) and
 * keeping `keys().hasOnly()` off `profile`.
 *
 * That is a load-bearing property of a file nobody edits for this feature,
 * which is exactly the kind of thing that gets tightened later by somebody
 * closing an unrelated hole. If a `hasOnly` is ever added to `profile` or to
 * `notifications` without listing every cell, switches stop saving with a
 * permission error and nothing else in the suite notices. These writes are the
 * alarm, and the source assertion below states the property directly rather
 * than only by its consequences.
 *
 * The last cases are the other half: the write is a member's own preference,
 * so it must not become a hole. Writing it may not carry any admin-set field,
 * and it may not be aimed at somebody else's document.
 *
 * EVERY CASE RUNS AS A MEMBER. The admin branch of the self-update rule is
 * resource-independent, so testing this as an admin would pass whatever the
 * member-facing half of the rule said.
 *
 * ## Mutation check (restore bit-exact afterwards)
 *
 *  1. Add `&& request.resource.data.profile.keys().hasOnly(['preferredName'])`
 *     to the users self-update rule -> the save tests and the source
 *     assertion go red.
 *  2. Delete `request.resource.data.role == resource.data.role` from the
 *     self-update branch -> the role-smuggling test goes red.
 *  3. Lower `smallEnough()`'s profile cap to 1 -> the size test goes red.
