/**
 * Rules tests for the V2-1 DELETION PROTOCOL — the surfaces it adds to
 * `firestore.rules`:
 *
 *  1. **`courseDeletions`** — the destroy audit log. Admin READ, and no client
 *     write at all. This log is the only surviving evidence of a destroy (the
 *     rows it describes are gone by definition), so the property that matters
 *     is not "members can't read it" — it is that *nobody*, admins included,
 *     can amend or erase it from a client. An append-only log its own actor can
 *     rewrite is not an audit trail, and the destroy flow's resumability means
 *     the row is read back by the same admin who started the cascade.
 *
 *  2. **`courseRuns.archived`** — the everyday soft path. Archive is the
 *     reversible half of the protocol (destroy is the irreversible half), and
 *     it is a WITHDRAWAL: an archived run drops out of the admin default list,
 *     the public catalogue, the /me live sections and the application windows.
 *     So it belongs in `runPinnedFieldsUnchanged` beside `channel` and
 *     `applicationCounts`, not in run content — which is the whole point,
 *     because a drafter-owner and a run's track leads legitimately hold the
 *     content lane all term and would otherwise be able to unpublish a live
 *     cohort with one field, silently, without touching the route.
 *
 * ## The one asymmetry to read carefully
 *
 * `approveCourse` holders ARE authorised to call
 * `PATCH /api/courses/runs/[runId]/archive`, and are NOT carved out of the pin.
 * That is deliberate and is the sharpest test in this file: the actor who may
 * archive must still go through the route (Admin SDK) to do it, so the archive
 * has a server-side gate in front of it rather than being a field an autosave
 * could carry. Admins keep the same unconditional-update carve-out they have
 * for every other pin in that function — it hands them nothing, since an admin
 * can already write `status: "cancelled"`, which withdraws a run harder.
 *
 * ## The destroy MARKER is pinned here too
 *
 * `beginDestroy()` (courseDeletion.ts) stamps `destroying` + `destroyAuditId`
 * on the run in the SAME transaction that opens the audit row. They are the
 * resume cursor, and they are `archived`'s siblings in every respect, so
 * they ride the same clause. A cleared `destroying` would make the next
 * invocation look fresh, so it would open a SECOND audit row and strand the
 * first at `completedAt: null`; a repointed `destroyAuditId` would send the
 * counts to somebody else's row and falsify the only surviving record of a
 * destroy. See the courseRuns comment for the full reasoning.
 *
 * ## The COURSE-level marker, and the task pointer the cascade sweeps on
 *
 * Two more pins keep one actor's write from aiming somebody else's cascade:
 *
 *  - `courses` carries the same `destroying` / `destroyAuditId` marker as a
 *    run, and its update branch admits COLLABORATORS, who may be plain
 *    members holding no course permission at all. The marker is pinned
 *    against them: the next real cascade reads a marker as a resume, so one
 *    pointing at an EXISTING courseDeletions row would skip its blockers and
 *    accumulate its counts (and its `completedAt`) onto an unrelated audit
 *    record. That is the runs-level pin's whole argument, one level up.
 *  - `tasks.sourceRef` is the pointer a RUN destroy sweeps on
 *    (`sourceRef.cohortId == runId` → `recursiveDelete`, taking comments,
 *    activity, attachments and Storage with it). Like `source`, it is pinned
 *    on the committee update branch and on the personal-task branch, and
 *    pinned null at create, so a client cannot aim a task at a run's
 *    cascade. The engine also filters the sweep on the task's `source`; these
 *    tests are the half that stops the field being aimed at all.
 *
 * ## Mutation check (each restored bit-exact afterwards)
 *
 *  1. `archived` stripped from `runPinnedFieldsUnchanged` → 6 pin tests red.
 *  2. the create-side `archived == false` clause stripped → the born-archived
 *     test red, everything else green.
 *  3. both run marker clauses stripped → the marker test red, rest green.
 *  4. the two marker clauses stripped from `coursePinnedFieldsUnchanged` →
 *     3 red (collaborator, owner+approver, repointing), rest green.
 *  5. the course create-side clean-start clauses stripped → 1 red (the
 *     born-mid-destroy course), rest green.
 *  6. the `sourceRef` clause stripped from the tasks committee UPDATE branch →
 *     2 red (the committee stamp, the mirror repoint), rest green.
 *  7. the create-side `sourceRef == null` clause stripped → 1 red (the create
 *     test, both lanes), rest green.
 *  8. the `sourceRef` clause stripped from the personal-task branch → 1 red
 *     (the personal creator), rest green.
 *
 * If you edit any of those clauses, redo it — a pin nobody has watched fail is
 * a comment.
