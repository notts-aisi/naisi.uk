/**
 * GUARD: every client-direct Firestore READ in `src` is allowed for the people
 * who actually run it.
 *
 * Two layers already have tests, and they each see half the problem.
 * `firestore.rules` is proven by the suites beside this one, which answer "may
 * this actor read this document". The source scans in `tests/` answer "which
 * file touches which collection". Neither answers the question: does the
 * QUERY THIS FILE ISSUES pass the rule for the PERSON THAT PAGE ADMITS.
 *
 * That gap exists because Firestore judges a `list` or a `listen` on the
 * query's SHAPE, not on the rows it returns. A query whose shape could match a
 * document the rule forbids is refused wholesale, before any document is read,
 * so an empty collection is no defence. The refusal is silent (an empty panel,
 * a console line), and an admin never reproduces it, because every rule here
 * gives an admin a resource-independent branch that matches the collection
 * entire. Three cases are pinned by name below:
 *
 *   1. `/profile`'s subscriptions listener must pin `audience` as well as
 *      `audienceId`: a query on `audienceId` alone is refused for a non-admin.
 *   2. `RoundEditor`'s unfiltered `courseRuns` list is refused for an
 *      appointed admissions reviewer holding no course key, because the run
 *      rule asks such a caller for a status clause.
 *   3. This suite's own sibling, `admissions.test.mjs`, carries
 *      `where("status", "!=", "draft")` on its member control for the same
 *      reason.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES, in order:
 *
 *   1. Scans `src` for every read issued through the client SDK, resolving
 *      collection names through the repo's constants (including the object
 *      constants `SITE_NOTICE_PATH` and `MAINTENANCE_LOG_PATH`), and matches
 *      each one BOTH ways against `client-queries.registry.mjs`: an
 *      unregistered read fails with its file, line and shape, and a registry
 *      entry matching nothing fails as stale. A read whose shape cannot be
 *      resolved statically (`useTasks`'s spread constraints, `useWeek`'s
 *      ternary reference) fails unless an entry for that file writes down the
 *      shapes it can take and why.
 *   2. Runs every registered query against the emulator as every persona the
 *      entry names, and asserts allowed or refused exactly as written down.
 *      `getCountFromServer` is judged on the same shape as the equivalent
 *      list, so the count sites are proven with a `get()` of the identical
 *      query, which each of those entries says.
 *   3. Pins the three cases above as named regression cases, plus a fourth for
 *      the registration reads that run BEFORE a `users` document exists, where
 *      the `isAdmin()` branch of a rule cannot even resolve the caller's role.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not prove a surface is reachable, only that the
 * read is allowed for the personas the entry claims can reach it. Naming the
 * gate honestly is a human step, and the entry's `reason` is where that
 * judgement is recorded. It also says nothing about writes, except where a
 * read precedes one, and nothing about Admin SDK code, which bypasses rules.
