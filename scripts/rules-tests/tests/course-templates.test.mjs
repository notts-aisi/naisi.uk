/**
 * Rules tests for V2-2 — CURRICULUM SNAPSHOTS, FACILITATOR NOTES, and the
 * TEMPLATE PROVENANCE pin on `courseRuns`. Three surfaces `firestore.rules`
 * gained, each with a different reason to exist:
 *
 *  1. **`courseTemplates` + its `weeks` subcollection.** Frozen snapshots of a
 *     cohort's curriculum. Every client write is denied — admins included, on
 *     BOTH levels — and that is the collection's whole value, not a
 *     tightening that could be relaxed later. Three arguments, all tested:
 *       * a snapshot is the record of what a cohort was ACTUALLY taught, and
 *         the seed of next year's run. One you can edit afterwards is just a
 *         second, worse copy of the run;
 *       * the week docs carry the material / exercise / checklist IDS that
 *         member progress is keyed on (`courseProgress/{runId}__{uid}__
 *         {itemId}`). A client able to rewrite an id inside a template would
 *         be aiming the NEXT cohort's progress keys, silently, a year early;
 *       * the collection is APPEND-ONLY — saving mints a new id — so there is
 *         no legitimate client write to admit in the first place.
 *     READ is the staff tier (admin / draftCourse / approveCourse / the
 *     SOURCE RUN's track leads), because drafters and leads have to browse
 *     versions to pick one, and a snapshot carries no PII.
 *
 *  2. **`courseMaterialNotes`.** The named half of the retrospective loop.
 *     Route-only writes (authority is a query over `courseGroups`, which a
 *     rule cannot run; `weekNumber` and `byName` are server-derived), and the
 *     retrospective's own read tier. Members are excluded outright, including
 *     from notes about materials they were taught: these are staff
 *     assessments of the curriculum, written on the understanding that the
 *     cohort is not the audience.
 *
 *  3. **`courseRuns.templateId` / `.templateLabel`.** Provenance, pinned into
 *     `runPinnedFieldsUnchanged` beside `archived` and the destroy marker.
 *
 * ## The two asymmetries to read carefully
 *
 * **The approveCourse holder is NOT carved out of the provenance pin.** They
 * ARE authorised to call `POST /api/courses/runs/[runId]/apply-template` —
 * and are still refused the field. That is the `archived` argument exactly:
 * the actor who may stamp provenance must go through the route (Admin SDK) to
 * do it, so the stamp always arrives with the copy that earned it rather than
 * as a field an autosave could carry. Admins keep their unconditional-update
 * carve-out, which hands them nothing they did not already have.
 *
 * **The track-lead read branch costs a `get()` per candidate row.** A
 * template carries no role fields of its own, so the branch resolves against
 * the SOURCE RUN. `allow read` covers `list`, and a list evaluates its rule
 * per candidate doc — the hazard `courseProgress` documents at length. Three
 * things make it safe rather than lucky: it is the LAST branch of a
 * short-circuiting `||` (so it never runs for an admin, drafter or approver),
 * the admin UI reads versions through the route, and a course holds a handful
 * of snapshots. The dangling-source-run test below pins the consequence: a
 * template whose run is gone DENIES the lead branch, and the privileged
 * branches short-circuit before it, so a destroyed source run never locks
 * staff out of their own history.
 *
 * ## Mutation check — RUN 2026-08-22, each restored bit-exact afterwards
 *
 * Every mutation was applied to `firestore.rules`, the WHOLE suite was run,
 * and the file restored (sha256 verified identical). Results are what
 * actually happened, not what was expected:
 *
 *  1. `allow write: if false` on `courseTemplates/{templateId}` relaxed to
 *     `isAdmin()` → 3 red: the create pin, the relabel pin, the delete pin.
 *     Rest green.
 *  2. the same on the `weeks` subcollection → 1 red: "refuses an ADMIN
 *     editing an item id inside a frozen week". Rest green.
 *  3. `|| isSourceRunTrackLead()` dropped from the template doc read → 1 red:
 *     the lead's single-doc read. The lead's SUBCOLLECTION read stays green,
 *     which is the tell that the two levels carry independent branches.
 *  4. the `courseMaterialNotes` read tier relaxed to `isSignedIn()` → 1 red:
 *     "refuses notes to members".
 *  5. `allow write: if false` on `courseMaterialNotes` relaxed to
 *     `isSignedIn()` → 1 red: the write refusals.
 *  6. `templateId`/`templateLabel` stripped from `runPinnedFieldsUnchanged`
 *     → 2 red: the track lead, and the drafter-owner/approver pair. Rest
 *     green — including the positive control, which is the half that proves
 *     the pin is not simply blocking every run edit.
 *  7. the create-side `templateId == '' && templateLabel == ''` clauses
 *     stripped → 1 red: the born-with-provenance run. Rest green.
 *
 * If you edit any of those clauses, redo it — a pin nobody has watched fail
 * is a comment.
