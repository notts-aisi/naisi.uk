/**
 * Sign-in provider guard: does each Firebase project have switched on exactly
 * the sign-in providers the shipped code calls?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The email registration route sets a password and then signs
 * the person in with it, so the Email/Password provider has to be switched on
 * in every project. A sign-in provider is a setting in a console, not a file
 * in this repository, so the expectation is written down HERE, next to the
 * code that depends on it, and every project is held to it. This is the same
 * shape as `check-api-key-restrictions.mjs`, which does it for API keys.
 *
 * TWO LAYERS, and a guard for each seam between them.
 *
 *  1. Code against this file. `tests/auth-providers.test.mjs` (offline, in
 *     `npm test`) reads every import from `firebase/auth` under `src` and
 *     requires each one to be classified below, in both directions: a new
 *     sign-in call with no provider named fails, and a provider no call needs
 *     any more fails too, because an unused provider is a door left open.
 *  2. This file against each project. That is what running this script does.
 *
 * HOW IT LOOKS, WITHOUT CREDENTIALS. The default mode asks the project the
 * question a browser asks: it attempts a sign-in that cannot succeed and reads
 * the refusal. A provider that is on refuses the CREDENTIAL
 * (`INVALID_LOGIN_CREDENTIALS`, `INVALID_IDP_RESPONSE`); a provider that is off
 * refuses the OPERATION (`PASSWORD_LOGIN_DISABLED`, `OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED`).
 * It needs only the project's public web key, which it fetches from the
 * project's own hosting endpoint at run time, so no key is written in this
 * repository and no credential is needed. It runs daily from
 * `.github/workflows/config-drift.yml` against every project.
 *
 * `--admin` reads the project's configuration instead of probing it, which
 * also covers a provider with no credential to refuse: anonymous sign-in
 * (probing it would CREATE an account when it is on) and phone. It needs
 * `firebaseauth.configs.get` on the project:
 *
 *   node scripts/check-auth-providers.mjs --admin --project <PROJECT_ID>
 *
 * with Application Default Credentials, or with a token in
 * `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
 *
 * A FAILED LOOK IS A FAILURE. A network error, a missing web key or an answer
 * this file does not recognise exits 2. A guard that passes when it could not
 * look reports an all-clear it did not earn.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/check-auth-providers.mjs                 # every project, public mode
 *   node scripts/check-auth-providers.mjs --project <PROJECT_ID>
 *   node scripts/check-auth-providers.mjs --admin --project <PROJECT_ID>
